Hello Andrew,

Our records indicate that you applied for graduation for the Fall 2020 term. Congratulations on reaching this milestone! We wanted you to be aware of the degree conferral process. As mentioned on the graduation application, the degree conferral process can take up to 6 weeks from the grade submission deadline.

Please keep an eye on your Degree Works notes section as this is where our staff will post notes regarding any potential issues with awarding the degree. If you need to change your graduation to a future semester, please email graduate@odu.edu.

Keep an eye on your LeoOnline graduation status. Once this status says “awarded”, you can then request transcripts from the Parchment website. Please note that if you purchase a transcript before the status is awarded, your transcript will not indicate a degree was awarded.

After the 6-week degree conferral process, diploma production will begin and will take 1-2 weeks. Your diploma will be mailed to your Permanent Address on LeoOnline. Please verify this address is correct and be sure to update this if you move before diplomas are sent.

Below is how your name will appear on your diploma. The school’s systems have your name in all caps and it needs to be converted programmatically to proper case. If your name is misspelled, your middle name is missing or if there are capitalization errors, please email graduate@odu.edu to have this corrected prior to diplomas being shipped. Please note that your diploma name must be your legal name.

For more information, please see our graduation page:
