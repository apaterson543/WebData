Attention Monarch Students

Have you had the opportunity to apply what you’ve learned inside the classroom to an outside active learning experience?  Some examples include service learning, internships, on-campus employment, practicums, research, student teaching, and clinical placements.   Faculty are collecting data about student experiences in these types of programs to improve the quality for current and future Monarchs.

If you have participated in one of these opportunities, please complete this web-based survey by November 20, 2020. Your participation is voluntary, and the survey should take about 10 minutes to complete and your responses are anonymous.  All those who complete the survey will have the opportunity to enter a drawing for a $100 gift card. Please click on the link below to begin the survey.
