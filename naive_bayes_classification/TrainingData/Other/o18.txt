Your classmate posted a new Question.

Thanksgiving

Unfortunately, I will not be going back to visit family this Thanksgiving because of the virus. I have some family that could get sick easily so I would rather stay at home. My boyfriend and I plan to cook Thanksgiving for the first time which I imagine will be very fun yet stressful! It will only be us and a neighbor that is also not going home this year so it will be a very small celebration. We will probably have a pretty normal Thanksgiving with turkey, mashed potatoes, stuffing, and green bean casserole since those aren't too hard to cook. I hope everyone has a great holiday!
