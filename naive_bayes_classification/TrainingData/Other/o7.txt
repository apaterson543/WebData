Class,

If you want to add new 3D (obj) models to P2, you need to change the Working Directory as follows.  Right click the project, select Properties, then select

Configuration Properties => Debugging => Working Directory

Change the value from "$(ProjectDir)\bin" to "$(ProjectDir)\src".

Then copy the new model(s) to src/Models.
