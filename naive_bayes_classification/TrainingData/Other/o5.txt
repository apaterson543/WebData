Hello,
Quiz #11 is now available on Blackboard. I will make quiz #11 optional, and the reasons for that are:

    I do not want the quiz time-window to overlap with the time-window of the final exam.
    Some students asked me if they can do something extra to enhance their grades.

Please make sure to carefully read the instructions before attempting the quiz, and make sure to take the quiz before it closes on Friday, December 11th at 7:00pm. The quiz covers the reading assignment of Module #11.

    Chapters #16 and #17 from the 9th edition of the textbook
    Chapter #18 and #19 from the 10th edition of the textbook

I will make the answers of the quiz available for you to review after all students finish taking the quiz.
The quiz time is 2 hours.
Thanks,
Dr. Ayman Elmesalami
