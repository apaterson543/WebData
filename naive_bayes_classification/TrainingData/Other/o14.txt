Classmates,

Good evening! I hope you're all doing well. I know it's a little late in the semester to create a discord server, but since we're coming to an end I know a lot of students are finishing up the homework assignments!

This link is for anyone that wants to join a Discord server for this class to receive advice/help. Basically what's offered in Piazza, but a little more instantaneous.

I'm not expecting a lot of people to join, as we barely have any time left in the semester, but if you want to give/receive help click the link below:
