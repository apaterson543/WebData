Your classmate posted a new Question.

Extra Credit Submission

If we want to turn in extra credit from previous assignments, should we add the extra credit to our old homework reports or make a new document with only the newly attempted extra credit? Also, should the extra credit be emailed for submission or should we add a new “ready to commit” message in our old assignments? Thank you.
