As well as a ban on serving alcohol, hospitality venues will only be allowed to open from 6am to 6pm as Ms Sturgeon said without the crackdown the virus could be \'out of control by the end of this month\'.\xc2\xa0But in five \'hotspot\' areas in Scotland\'s central belt, which includes Edinburgh and Glasgow and is home to approximately 70 per cent of the population, pubs will be closed altogether apart from takeaways until October 26 and people will be advised against using public transport.\xc2\xa0Hospitality bosses last night described the decision as a \'total catastrophe\' that will be the \'final straw,\' for hundreds of venues.Sector chiefs said Ms Sturgeon had \'effectively signed a death sentence for many businesses\' and said the \'real problem\' was socialising at home.The Scottish Licensed Trade Association told The Telegraph that more than two-thirds of pubs, bars and restaurants \'could be mothballed or go under\', along with more than half the sector\xe2\x80\x99s jobs.\xc2\xa0Meanwhile, Mr Hancock appeared to pave the way for a similar localised crackdown on pubs in England as he said that \'outside your household and socialising between households, the highest place in incidence of likely transmission, measured by where people have contacts, is unfortunately hospitality\'.\xc2\xa0However, a targeted shutdown of hospitality venues in hotspot areas appears more likely than a nationwide approach, with Downing Street still committed to its strategy of local lockdowns in specific areas where the virus has spiked.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Imposing some of the toughest restrictions in Europe, Ms Sturgeon said that if it was \'a purely one dimensional decision\' about tackling the disease there would be even harsher action, but she was considering the wider economy and wellbeing.But it provoked howls of protest from the hospitality industry, who branded the clampdown a \'total catastrophe\' and warned a swathe of business will go under permanently.\xc2\xa0The extraordinary step - which Ms Sturgeon said would be accompanied with \xc2\xa340million of new compensation for stricken firms - came as Scotland reported more than 1,000 new infections in a day.In another drastic move that could pre-empt policy in England, national exams in Scotland are also being abandoned for next year and replaced with teacher assessments. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson is currently only expected to delay the exam season south of the border by three weeks.\xc2\xa0Ms Sturgeon\'s announcements will heap pressure on Boris Johnson, who was confronted this afternoon with damning figures showing local restrictions in England are failing to curb cases, with\xc2\xa0ministers and advisers at war over what to do next.At a stormy PMQs session, Mr Johnson stressed the impact of the surge was being felt worst in the North, saying that showed that the Government\'s mix of tough local lockdowns and national restrictions like the Rule of Six and 10pm pubs curfew was the right one.The backing for \'differentiated\' measures in England indicates that the premier is still resisting calls from scientists for a blanket crackdown - in an apparent boost for Cabinet ministers alarmed over the threat to millions of jobs and civil liberties.But Labour leader Keir Starmer launched a furious attack on Mr Johnson in the Commons, saying 19 out of 20 areas subjected to local curbs over the past two months have actually seen infections rise. He insisted that the measures were \'not working\', and singled out the controversial 10pm curfew on pubs saying the government had failed to provide any \'scientific basis\'.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As chaotic infighting threatened to engulf the government, allies of Chancellor Rishi Sunak, regarded as the leading \'hawk\' on the need to protect the economy, today denied claims he has been trying to shut \'dove\' Michael Gove out of decisions on what areas will be subject to the most draconian restrictions.\xc2\xa0The wrangling is believed to be holding up the announcement of a new three-tier \'traffic light\' system, intended to clear up confusion about what rules apply where in England.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The tensions between ministers was underlined this morning with Mr Hancock telling business leaders that hospitalisation rates have risen \'really quite sharply\' and the Government has a \'very serious problem on our hands\'.\xc2\xa0But Trade Secretary Liz Truss suggested that the current balance of restrictions was \'right\' in a round of interviews.\xc2\xa0Meanwhile, leaders from four Covid-hit northern cities, Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds and Newcastle have written to Mr Johnson begging him not to ramp up coronavirus curbs again - which could mean pubs and restaurants being shut altogether.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Nicola Sturgeon (pictured today) has unveiled a dramatic \'circuit breaker\' squeeze to coincide with the school half-term north of the border The number of daily cases in Scotland has risen from under 300 two weeks ago \xe2\x80\x93 when a ban on households mixing indoors was introduced \xe2\x80\x93 to see 1,054 reported today more videos 1 2 3 Watch video China\'s President Xi violently coughs throughout speech in Shenzhen Watch video \'Guard\' chickens swarm around driver as he delivers package Watch video Nail-biting moment dog escapes from hungry crocodile Watch video China unveils weaponised drones that can be launched from a truck Watch video Rudy Giuliani is caught mocking Chinese people Watch video Hilarious moment chihuahua is chased by a charging tortoise Watch video Hilarious moment stretching golden retriever falls off couch Watch video President trump dances to \'YMCA\' after massive rally in PA Watch video Woman uses whisker to remove lumps while cooking mince meat Watch video Group of teens laugh as they re-enact George Floyd death Watch video Adorable moment determined koala is spotted swimming across a river Watch video Pet emu runs around in circles as tries to play with garden hose The Scottish government\'s latest slides show the growing coronavirus case rate north of the border Figures tracking the crucial R number for the virus also show an alarming increase since September\xc2\xa0 more videos 1 2 3 Watch video China\'s President Xi violently coughs throughout speech in Shenzhen Watch video \'Guard\' chickens swarm around driver as he delivers package Watch video Nail-biting moment dog escapes from hungry crocodile Watch video LAPD involved in shooting armed man threatening people at gas station Watch video China unveils weaponised drones that can be launched from a truck Watch video Rudy Giuliani is caught mocking Chinese people Watch video Hilarious moment chihuahua is chased by a charging tortoise Watch video Hilarious moment stretching golden retriever falls off couch Watch video President trump dances to \'YMCA\' after massive rally in PA Watch video Woman uses whisker to remove lumps while cooking mince meat Watch video Adorable moment determined koala is spotted swimming across a river Watch video Pet emu runs around in circles as tries to play with garden hose In other twists and turns in the coronavirus crisis today:The UK recorded 14,162 more coronavirus cases, with the number of people testing positive for the disease every day doubling in a fortnight;\xc2\xa0NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens told the NHS Providers conference that there were \'disturbing\' signs coronavirus was surging and the health service will have to be \'agile\' to manage the disease alongside normal winter pressures;\xc2\xa0Sir Keir hinted that Labour will join Tory rebels in opposing the controversial 10pm curfew for pubs in a crucial vote next week, raising the prospect that the government could lose;\xc2\xa0Scientists from the world\'s top universities have penned an open letter calling for the UK and US to build herd immunity to Covid-19 by letting it spread in young people;Concerns have been raised over the supply of vital testing materials for a range of conditions, including Covid-19, following a supply chain problem with pharmaceutical giant Roche;The number of Covid-19 hospital admissions in England has soared by 25 per cent in a day, government data has revealed.\xc2\xa0 Sturgeon calls time: Scotland\'s new Covid regulations in full All pubs, restaurants and cafes barred from selling\xc2\xa0alcohol indoors for 16 days.They will additionally face a curfew forcing them to close by 6pm each evening.Outdoor bars, restaurants and cafes will be allowed to remain open up until 10pm and will be allowed to sell alcohol up to that time.\xc2\xa0In five areas of Scotland\'s Central Belt - which includes Edinburgh and Glasgow - there will be additional restrictions on opening.Pubs, restaurants and licenced cafes in the \'hotspots\' of Greater Glasgow &amp; Clyde, Lanarkshire, Ayrshire &amp; Arran, Lothian, and Forth Valley, will be forced to close to all but takeaway customers.\xc2\xa0The measures come into force at 6pm on Friday for 16 days until October 25.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Residents of these areas have also been urged to avoid public transport unless absolutely necessary in the next two weeks. They should only use it to get to work, school or for other unavoidable journeys.\xc2\xa0Outdoor live events will be banned in the five areas for the next two weeks.Snooker and pool halls, indoor bowling alleys, casinos and bingo halls will close in these areas for two weeks from October 10.Contact sports and indoor group exercise for those aged 18 and over is suspended for the same period.Face coverings will become mandatory in indoor communal settings.An additional \xc2\xa340 million in funding will be made available to businesses impacted by the new restrictions. Advertisement Ms Sturgeon said that indoor hospitality venues will only be allowed to operate between 6am and 6pm daily, selling food and non-alcoholic drinks only.Outdoor bars, restaurants and cafes will be allowed to remain open up until 10pm and will be allowed to sell alcohol up to that time.The restrictions will come into force at 6pm on Friday and are intended to end after October 25.However, all licensed premises in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, Ayrshire and Arran, Lothian and Forth Valley health board areas will be closed for both indoor and outdoor operations.Cafes without a licence to sell alcohol will be allowed to open until 6pm, the First Minister said, to counter social isolation.People in the central belt of Scotland have been asked to avoid public transport unless absolutely necessary in the next two weeks.While a travel restriction is not being enforced on people in those five areas, Ms Sturgeon urged those living in these areas not to travel beyond their own health boards.Ms\xc2\xa0Sturgeon insisted it was her \'firm intention\' that the clampdown will end after two weeks.\'It is our firm intention these measures will be lefted at the end of two weeks... but obviously it stands to reason we will moitor the virus between now and then.\'\xc2\xa0She said: \'Let me be clear. We are not going back into lockdown today.\'We are not closing schools, colleges or universities.\'We are not halting the remobilisation of the NHS for non-Covid care. And we are not asking people to stay at home.\'So while the measures I announce today will feel like a backward step, they are in the interests of protecting our progress overall.\'It is by taking the tough but necessary action now, that we hope to avoid even tougher action in future.\'Scottish government modelling released today suggested that without \'further intervention\' the daily number of coronavirus cases could reach 35,000 by Christmas.\xc2\xa0The number of daily cases has risen from under 300 two weeks ago \xe2\x80\x93 when a ban on households mixing indoors was introduced \xe2\x80\x93 to see 1,054 reported today.\xc2\xa0UKHospitality Executive Director for Scotland Willie Macleod said: \'This is a total catastrophe. Scottish hospitality is already on the brink and is unable to look ahead with any degree of confidence.\'Forced closures will spell the end for many, many venues which have no cash flow and will have exhausted their reserves. Severe restrictions to those businesses not forced to close will amount to a closure for many. It is likely to be the final straw for many that were only just hanging on. We are going to see businesses fold and many jobs lost.He added: \'It looks as though the \xc2\xa340m announced by the First Minister will not nearly be sufficient to support the sector. Any support to underwrite furlough will have to go far beyond the Job Support Scheme, which seems unlikely to be taken up by many hospitality businesses.\'In bruising clashes with Sir Keir in the Commons, Mr Johnson seemed to close off the possibility of an imminent national clampdown.\xc2\xa0\'Although the cases in the country are considerably up across the country this week on last week, the seven-day statistics show that there are now 497 cases per 100,000 in Liverpool, 522 cases per 100,000 in Manchester, 422 in Newcastle,\' he said. Fears over shortage of Covid and cancer tests after \'warehouse\' failure\xc2\xa0Concerns have been raised over the supply of vital testing materials for a range of conditions, including Covid-19, following a supply chain problem with pharmaceutical giant Roche.On Tuesday, Roche said it had experienced a \'very significant drop\' in its processing capacity due to a problem with its Sussex distribution centre in Newhaven, the only one in the UK.It has been reported that the shortage includes vital reagents, screening kits and swabs.In addition to providing these chemicals and parts used in Covid-19 tests, Roche also provides materials for a wide range of procedures including blood and urine tests, as well as diabetic care.It comes days after the Government confirmed a technical glitch meant 16,000 positive test results had been missed, leaving contract tracers chasing thousands of contacts who needed to self-isolate.The Government is facing mounting pressure to increase coronavirus testing capacity as cases continue to rise, with 14,542 new cases recorded yesterday - meaning the number of people testing positive for Covid-19 every day has tripled in a fortnight. Advertisement \'The key point there is the local regional approach combined with the national approach remains correct because two-thirds of those admitted into hospital on Sunday were in the North West, North East and Yorkshire.\'But Sir Keir unleashed a tirade, pointing out that the government\'s local lockdown were clearly \'not working\'.\xc2\xa0\'On care homes, protective equipment, exams, testing. The Prime Minister ignores the warning signs, hurtles towards a car crash, then looks in the rear mirror, says \'what\'s all that about?\' he said.\'It\'s quite literally government in hindsight.\'Sir Keir added: \'All the Prime Minister has to say is it is too early to say if restrictions are working but it\'s obvious that something\'s gone wrong here, so what\'s the Prime Minister going to do about it?\'The Labour leader pointed out that in Mr Johnson\'s own local authority,\xc2\xa0Hillingdon, there were currently 62 cases per 100,000, and no local restrictions.\xc2\xa0\'But in 20 local areas across England, restrictions were imposed when infection rates were much lower. In Kirklees it was just 29 per 100,000,\' he said.\'Local communities, Prime Minister, genuinely don\'t understand these differences. Can he please explain for them?\'Mr Johnson replied: \'I wish I could pretend that everything was going to be rosy in the Midlands or indeed in London where, alas, we are also seeing infections rise.\'That is why we need a concerted national effort, we need to follow the guidance, we need hands, face, space, get a test if you have symptoms and obey the Rule of Six.\'Sir Keir insisted that he does support the Government\'s Rule of Six.But he struck a starkly different tone on whether Labour will support the England-wide 10pm curfew on bars and restaurants, which critics say is causing more harm than good as revellers merely spill out on to the streets.\xc2\xa0\'The Prime Minister can\'t explain why an area goes into restriction, he can\'t explain what the different restrictions are, he can\'t explain how restrictions end \xe2\x80\x93 this is getting ridiculous,\' Sir Keir said. Labour listed 21 areas where the case rate had increased since local lockdowns. However, the party accepted that in Leicester cases had been higher shortly before the restrictions were imposed than after, and so did not include it in the overall tally. Leicester and Oadby &amp; Wigston were counted as one in the final total because they were originally treated as one area when the government brought in the restrictions Boris Johnson (pictured left at PMQs today)\xc2\xa0is desperately trying to balance fears over a surge in infections and hospitalisations, particularly in the North.\xc2\xa0But Labour leader Keir Starmer (right) said 19 out of 20 areas subjected to local curbs over the past two months have actually seen infections rise more videos 1 2 3 Watch video China\'s President Xi violently coughs throughout speech in Shenzhen Watch video \'Guard\' chickens swarm around driver as he delivers package Watch video Nail-biting moment dog escapes from hungry crocodile Watch video LAPD involved in shooting armed man threatening people at gas station Watch video China unveils weaponised drones that can be launched from a truck Watch video Rudy Giuliani is caught mocking Chinese people Watch video Hilarious moment chihuahua is chased by a charging tortoise Watch video Hilarious moment stretching golden retriever falls off couch Watch video President trump dances to \'YMCA\' after massive rally in PA Watch video Woman uses whisker to remove lumps while cooking mince meat Watch video Adorable moment determined koala is spotted swimming across a river Watch video Pet emu runs around in circles as tries to play with garden hose The Scottish government slides suggest that daily cases could hit 35,000 by Christmas without further intervention - compared to around 1,000 now - and highlight the rise in hospitalisations The Scottish government\'s comparison of the outbreaks across Europe show that the UK surge is sharper than many others more videos 1 2 3 Watch video China\'s President Xi violently coughs throughout speech in Shenzhen Watch video \'Guard\' chickens swarm around driver as he delivers package Watch video Nail-biting moment dog escapes from hungry crocodile Watch video LAPD involved in shooting armed man threatening people at gas station Watch video China unveils weaponised drones that can be launched from a truck Watch video Rudy Giuliani is caught mocking Chinese people Watch video Hilarious moment chihuahua is chased by a charging tortoise Watch video Hilarious moment stretching golden retriever falls off couch Watch video President trump dances to \'YMCA\' after massive rally in PA Watch video Woman uses whisker to remove lumps while cooking mince meat Watch video Adorable moment determined koala is spotted swimming across a river Watch video Pet emu runs around in circles as tries to play with garden hose National exams in Scotland being abandoned for next year\xc2\xa0 National exams in Scotland are being abandoned for next year and replaced with teacher assessments, in another drastic move that could pre-empt policy in England,.\xc2\xa0Education Secretary Gavin Williamson is currently only expected to delay the exam season south of the border by three weeks.\xc2\xa0Next year\'s National 5 exams have been cancelled and will be replaced by grades reached through alternative assessment and teacher judgment, Scotland\'s Education Secretary has announced.In a statement to the Scottish Parliament, John Swinney said: \'Due to the level of disruption already caused by Covid, and due to the likely disruption faced by some or all pupils and students this academic year, a full exam diet is simply too big a risk. It would not be fair.\'Higher and Advanced Higher exams will be pushed back by two weeks in 2021 until May 13, he added. Advertisement \'Next week, this House will vote on whether to approve the 10pm rule. The Prime Minister knows that there are deeply-held views across the country in different ways on this. One question is now screaming out: is there a scientific basis for the 10pm rule?\'Mr Johnson shot back: \'The basis on which we set out the curtailment of hospitality was the basis on which he accepted it two weeks ago \xe2\x80\x93 that is to reduce the spread of the virus and that is our objective.\'The UK government\'s scientific experts have been publicly calling for \'urgent and drastic action\' to curb spiralling infection figures and growing hospital admission.\xc2\xa0SAGE member John Edmunds said there needed to be a nationwide clampdown swiftly, saying the current package of local lockdowns, the Rule of Six and 10pm pubs curfew were obviously not working.Mr Edmunds told the BBC\'s Newsnight: \'These local restrictions that are being put into place in the north really haven\'t been very effective, we can see rates still going up, we need to take much more stringent measures, not just in the north of England \xe2\x80\x94 we need to do it countrywide.\xc2\xa0\'We have to do a whole package across the country \xe2\x80\xa6 I would include circuit break lockdowns to bring the cases right down.\'He was particularly scathing about the\xc2\xa010pm curfew, which has been criticised for making matters worse by fueling partying on the streets and in homes.\'I really don\'t think it does anything,\' he said.Professor Calum Semple, who specialises in disease outbreaks, urged a \'circuit breaker\' of perhaps two weeks of harsh restrictions.\xc2\xa0Prof Semple said \'a circuit breaker a couple of weeks ago would have been a really good idea\'.He added: \'It\'s always easier to reduce an outbreak at the earlier stage than to let it run and then try to reduce it at a later stage.\'So, yes, circuit breakers are certainly something we should be thinking about on a national basis.\'Stephen Reicher, professor of social psychology at the University of St Andrews and another SAGE member, told BBC Radio 4\'s Today programme there was a \'window of opportunity\' to stop the outbreak getting back to March levels by the end of the month.\'I do think it\'s important to do something because if you look at the figures at the moment, the level of infections is about 10 per cent of what it was at the peak in March, but, at the rate of doubling, it would probably be at the same as the peak in March by the end of October,\' he said.\xc2\xa0\'So the good news is we have a window of opportunity to do something.\'If we squander that window of opportunity, then we really are in trouble, then we really would be talking about going back to March in terms of lockdown measures. But we\'re not talking about that now. We\'ve got time.\'\xc2\xa0 First casualty of 10pm curfew: 200-year-old brewer Greene King will close 79 pubs and restaurants\xc2\xa0 Hundreds of jobs are on the line as scores of pubs are set to be shut by Greene King after the 10pm coronavirus curfew and lockdown decimated customThe company - which has more than 3,000 pubs across the country - today started a consultation process with 800 employees about a redundancy process.Bosses at the firm, which has nearly 1,700 managed pubs and 1,000 tenanted venues, wants to redeploy affected staff wherever possible.It wants to close 79 pubs and restaurants and are understood to believe one-third of them will be permanent.A spokesman said: \'The continued tightening of the trading restrictions for pubs, which may last another six months, along with the changes to government support was always going to make it a challenge to reopen some of our pubs.\'Therefore, we have made the difficult decision not to reopen 79 sites, including the 11 Loch Fyne restaurants we announced last week.\'Around one-third will be closed permanently and we hope to be able to reopen the others in the future.\' Advertisement At a CBI webinar this morning, Mr Hancock warned that the government has a \'very serious problem on our hands\'.\xc2\xa0\'It is a challenge, and everybody will have seen, from the rising case rates and unfortunately the rising hospitalisation rates which have risen really quite sharply in the last week or so, that we have got a very serious problem on our hands,\' he said.\'The challenge is how to deal with this second peak in a way that has as little damage as possible. Thankfully we know far more about it than first time around.\'He dropped a hint that hotspots in the North face tougher restrictions on pubs, likely to mean closures.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\'Outside your household and socialising between households, the highest place in incidence of likely transmission, measured by where people have contacts, is unfortunately hospitality,\' he said.\'Now obviously that finding is not good news in terms of the policy action we have to take for that sector.\'But Ms Truss suggested the current balance of restrictions was \'right\'.\'We\'re hearing voices on one side of the debate saying do more and we are hearing voices on the other side of the debate (saying) do less,\' she told Sky News.\'We are trying to keep the balance. I think we have got the balance right. Of course we have got to be constantly reviewing it as time goes on, making sure that the policies are right for each local part of the country.\'Ms Truss told BBC Radio 4\'s Today programme: \'I think we are striking the right balance between allowing people to go about their daily lives, allowing them to continue with their jobs, making sure children are at school, which is absolutely vital for the future, while trying to deal with this terrible disease.\'Downing Street also played down suggestions of new national measures but said the Government would not hesitate to act on a \'local basis\' if necessary.\'We keep all of the measures we have under review. But we have recently set out a package of measures with the specific intention of reducing the R rate and limiting the spread of the virus,\' the spokesman said.\'We are looking at a wide range of data in terms of the number of positive cases per 100,000, also the number of hospitalisations and people who are moved into intensive care units and also, sadly, the number of deaths.\'We have set out that if there is a need to go further on a local basis then we won\'t hesitate to do what is required to protect the NHS and protect lives.\'The Telegraph claimed that in a bid for tighter control over any new lockdown measures, Mr Sunak wants to create a new committee of himself, Mr Johnson and Health Secretary Matt Hancock, to decide which towns are placed into the highest alert level.Such a committee would exclude Mr Gove, believed to be an advocate of restrictions, from the decision-making process.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0However, allies of the Chancellor told MailOnline he \'is not dictating who should be on what committee\' and did not want the \'red\' areas decided by just three people.It comes amid growing discontent on the Tory benches over the government\'s 10pm curfew on hospitality businesses - with a rebellion expected on a vote next week.Speculation about further government action intensified yesterday as the UK reported 14,542 new coronavirus\xc2\xa0cases, an increase of almost 2,000 on the previous 24 hours.The increase has continued after ironing out an artificial spike cased by a \'computer glitch\' which saw 16,000 cases missed off the government\'s reporting system.Test and Trace are still scrambling to contact 6,000 positive cases find out who they might potentially have infected - thought to be around 50,000 people.Along with growing infection data, yesterday\'s figures also showed a rise in hospitalisations to the highest daily total in four months.\xc2\xa0In another blow to hopes the virus is being brought under control, official NHS data shows there were 478 new hospital admissions in England on Sunday - the most recent day figures are available for.The figure is 25 per cent increase on Saturday\'s data, when 386 people were admitted the hospital with Covid-19. It also represents a four-month high, the likes of which have not been seen since June 3, when the figure was 491.Data also shows the number of people on ventilators is on the rise, from 259 a week ago to 349 on Sunday.

It was 27.5 the week before.Covid-19 preys on the elderly, with top scientists estimating it kills around one in five of people over 75. For comparison, experts believe the mortality rate is less than 0.1 per cent for anyone under 45 \xe2\x80\x94 and even lower for children.PHE data, which takes into account cases diagnosed between September 21 and 27, shows a similar spike has been seen for people in their sixties and seventies.The infection rate among people aged 70 to 79 currently stands at 20.6, up from 17.4 the week before and 4.6 at the end of August.For people aged 60-69 it is now 34.2, an increase on the 27.5 last week. It has more than quadrupled since the figure of 7.5 a month ago.Cases have risen since last week for every age group except under-10s, where rates appear to have stabilised. Twenty-somethings are still driving the outbreak (95.0 up from 81.2), followed by 10-19 year olds (76.7 up from 53.7).Covid-19 infection data for last week will be published by PHE this Friday, when the government-run agency updates its national surveillance report.

This is up from 59 per 100,000 in the seven days to September 25.\xc2\xa0The director of public health for Nottingham, Alison Challenger, said current restrictions \'are no longer enough to stop the spread of the virus\'.\xc2\xa0Other areas with high rates are Knowsley and Liverpool, while Newcastle upon Tyne, Sheffield and Leeds have recorded large jumps in their infection rate over the past seven days. MPs back Rule of Six in Commons vote with just 17 politicians opposing it despite widespread Tory fury at coronavirus law they fear will \'do more harm than good\'\xc2\xa0MPs overwhelmingly backed the controversial Rule of Six in a Commons vote last night -\xc2\xa0 but Boris Johnson was left in no doubt about the anger on the Tory backbenches.The\xc2\xa0Covid-19 regulations which enforce the rules on gatherings in England was passed by 287 votes to 17 - a majority of\xc2\xa0270 -\xc2\xa0 in Westminster.The regulations are already in force, with the motion simply offering a retrospective vote on it.\xc2\xa0But a slew of Tories indicated they would abstain rather than support it, using the debate beforehand to attack Government ministers over the scope of the rules.Steve Baker, a former Brexit\xc2\xa0minister, said he had \'real concerns\' about the \'appalling\' cost of the measures, while Sir Graham Brady, the leader of the influential 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, descrbied the measures as a \'massive intrusion into the private lives of the British people\'.And fellow MP Huw Merriman, who is chair of the transport select committee, said he feared the measures would do \'more harm than good.\'\xc2\xa0However, there was little prospect of the measures failing to pass the Commons vote after Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told reporters on Tuesday that his party would back the measures.\xc2\xa0Setting out his opposition ahead of the vote, Mr Baker said: \'I have real concerns about the very high cost of these measures.\'[It is an] absolutely appalling set of costs which people are bearing and the anecdotes now [are] increasingly rising of poor compliance, indeed people seem to have a gap between their intentions to comply versus what they actually do.\'\xc2\xa0He added: \'It\'s not clear now that the benefit outweighs the costs of lockdown.

Scottish hospitality is already on the brink and is unable to look ahead with any degree of confidence.\'Forced closures will spell the end for many, many venues which have no cash flow and will have exhausted their reserves.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Nicola Sturgeon has banned the sale of alcohol in Scottish pubs and restaurants for 16 days under new Covid-19 regulations From Friday, there will be no alcohol for sale at pubs, and a new 6pm closing time will come into effect The SNP leader warned politicians in Holyrood today that Covid-19 cases had started to surge among the older population, as she introduced the alcohol ban, which will last for at least 16 days from Friday.In five \'hotspot\' areas pubs will be closed altogether apart from takeaways until October 26 and people will be advised against using public transport.Mr Mcleod added: \'Severe restrictions to those businesses not forced to close will amount to a closure for many.\xc2\xa0\'It is likely to be the final straw for many that were only just hanging on. We are going to see businesses fold and many jobs lost.\'The First Minister stated that hospitality was by far the most impacted of sectors and we now need urgent confirmation of the details of the support package and how it will be applied.\xc2\xa0\'Without detail, it looks as though the \xc2\xa340m announced by the First Minister will not nearly be sufficient to support the sector.\xc2\xa0\'Any support to underwrite furlough will have to go far beyond the Job Support Scheme, which seems unlikely to be taken up by many hospitality businesses.

We cannot afford to be left in limbo. It will just mean businesses unable to plan, employees worried for their jobs, consumer confidence shattered and businesses all the more likely to fail.\xc2\xa0\'The Government has to move quickly to save businesses and keep jobs alive.\'\xc2\xa0 RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Brutal moment a cop tackles a young girl to the ground with...
