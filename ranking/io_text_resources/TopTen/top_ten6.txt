coronavirus diagnosis models positive masculinity\xe2\x80\x94rational and unbowed. Heather Mac Donald October 5, 2020 Covid-19Politics and law The media and Democratic establishments are in a frenzy of Schadenfreude over President Trump\xe2\x80\x99s Covid diagnosis. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s contracting the disease, they argue, discredits any coronavirus policy short of lockdowns and mandatory mask-wearing, outdoors as well as in. Trump is now \xe2\x80\x9cexhibit No. 1 for the failure of his leadership on coronavirus,\xe2\x80\x9d Democratic pollster Geoff Garin told the New York Times.By contrast, former Vice President Joe Biden\xe2\x80\x99s basement-bunker response has been vindicated, such commentators allege. Biden drove home his status as the country\xe2\x80\x99s premiere symbol of safetyism on Friday by giving a masked and muffled speech in the vast outdoors of Grand Rapids. No one was within yards of him; Biden could not possibly have become infected or infected anyone else, since transmission in well-ventilated outdoor spaces is virtually nonexistent. Yet such displays of coronavirus virtue-signaling will now multiply exponentially, especially from masked television reporters speaking en plein air to a camera yards away.New York Times columnist Frank Bruni claims that Trump\xe2\x80\x99s infection proves that the country has been lax in its coronavirus response. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is time, at long last, to learn. To be smarter. To be safer. To be more responsible, to others as well as to ourselves,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote on Saturday. \xe2\x80\x9cWe cannot erase the mistakes made in America\xe2\x80\x99s response to the coronavirus, but we can vow not to continue making them.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cBe safer?\xe2\x80\x9d The United States has wiped out decades of hard-won prosperity by following the spirit-crushing injunction to \xe2\x80\x9cstay safe.\xe2\x80\x9d The lockdowns have destroyed the dreams of thousands of entrepreneurs and have put millions out of work, leaving cities like New York moribund ghost towns. The school closures are consigning millions of children worldwide to stunted lives due to delayed, if not now permanently deferred, acquisition of reading, writing, and socialization skills. Children are being inculcated into a culture of fear.But in Frank Bruni\xe2\x80\x99s world, Americans have been indifferent to risk and have insisted on plunging ahead with their ordinary lives in the face of it. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s illness points out \xe2\x80\x9canother moral,\xe2\x80\x9d Bruni writes, \xe2\x80\x9calso obvious but apparently necessary to articulate: There is a real risk in being cavalier. The president is now the embodiment of that.\xe2\x80\x9dThe argument that Trump\xe2\x80\x99s infection demonstrates anything about a proper coronavirus strategy entails a logical fallacy, however. It is neither a vindication nor a refutation of either man\xe2\x80\x99s policy choices that Trump has gotten the coronavirus and Biden (so far) has not. Though Trump has not been entirely consistent in his position on lockdowns and social distancing, he has emphasized the need to reopen the economy and get people working again. Biden, on the other hand, has never stopped arguing that getting the virus under control through moratoria on ordinary human activity is the precondition to reopening the economy (even as he blames Trump for the unemployment caused by lockdowns). The fate of these two individuals tells us nothing about the overall wisdom of their respective positions, which must be evaluated in terms of larger populations and tradeoffs. Making policy based on Trump\xe2\x80\x99s recent infection would, ironically, replicate his own oft-decried narcissism. And if Trump\xe2\x80\x99s infection is determinative, why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the death of someone who failed to get treatment for late-stage cancer during the medical shutdowns be determinative as well? The validity of any given policy choice that affects thousands must be judged based on averages, not individual cases.We set highway speeding limits to maximize convenience at what we consider an acceptable risk to human life. It is statistically certain that every year, there will be tens of thousands of driving deaths. A considerable portion of those deaths could be averted by \xe2\x80\x9cfollowing the science\xe2\x80\x9d of force and velocity and enforcing a speed limit of, say, 15 miles an hour. But we tolerate motor-vehicle deaths because we value driving 75 miles an hour on the highway, and up to 55 miles an hour in cities, more than we do saving those thousands of lives. When those deaths come\xe2\x80\x94nearly 100 a day in 2019\xe2\x80\x94we do not cancel the policy. Nor would it be logical to cancel a liberal highway speed because a legislator who voted for it died in a car accident.We could reduce coronavirus transmission to zero by locking everyone in a separate cell until a vaccine was developed. There are some public-health experts who from the start appeared ready to implement such radical social distancing. The extent to which we veer from that maximal coronavirus protection policy depends on how we value its costs and the competing goods: forgone life-saving medical care and deaths of despair from unemployment and social isolation, on the one hand, and the ability to support one\xe2\x80\x99s family through work and to build prosperity through entrepreneurship, on the other. The advocates of maximal lockdowns have rarely conceded such trade-offs, but they are ever-present.It is not even clear that a more work-friendly policy would lead to more deaths. While the profile of the typical coronavirus decedent has been known for months\xe2\x80\x94median age 80, suffering from co-morbidities that likely would have killed the person anyway\xe2\x80\x94the exact path of transmission remains mysterious. There is no correlation globally between degree of lockdowns and coronavirus death rates. Countries such as Britain that imposed strict lockdowns have massively higher death rates than many countries, such as Japan, that mandated no lockdowns. Deaths and hospitalizations are going down in localities that were more commerce-friendly. There is still no uncontroverted evidence on mask-wearing. Thousands upon thousands of people who have assiduously worn masks have gotten the virus; thousands upon thousands who have not worn masks have not gotten it. Countries with extensive mask-wearing show no better results than several where people breathe free outdoors. What we do know is that transmission occurs overwhelmingly in poorly ventilated indoor spaces, between individuals who have been in close contact for a considerable period of time\xe2\x80\x9415 minutes, in the CDC\xe2\x80\x99s contact-tracing guidelines. The viral load in circulating outdoor air is too low to pose a risk to people passing one another in ordinary street interactions.The long-known facts about the distribution of mortality risk from the coronavirus\xe2\x80\x94relatively high at the upper age and illness range, negligible in the young\xe2\x80\x94have made no difference to the tyranny of fear. On average, the coronavirus is, according to new WHO data, not more deadly than the flu, yet the conflation of cases with deaths is now absolute. When California State University, Long Beach, a campus of 37,000 students, shuts down because five students tested positive for the virus, we are in the realm of hysteria. When the New York Times portrays a 101-year-old military veteran as a coronavirus fatality, as opposed to someone who died of old age; when the Milwaukee coroner does the same for the death of an 89-year-old male with dementia, hypertensive and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and chronic renal failure, you know that the media and public-health establishments are looking for any excuse to inflate the death numbers.Lockdown proponents are hoping that Trump will follow the course of British prime minister Boris Johnson, who reversed his position on keeping the economy open after his own hospitalization for coronavirus. Trump should foreswear such a self-involved about-face. Either a policy is valid, or it is not; its impact on any given policymaker should not determine that judgment, even if the human mind works from personal experience outward.Instead, Trump should tell the American public something that it has needed to hear from a political leader for months: we must go on with our lives. There will be more coronavirus cases; there will be, tragically, more deaths. But we cannot shut down our human interactions in order to prevent one kind of death. We have never done so before, and the consequences of having done so this year will cripple human life for generations to come if we do not overcome fear now.Trump articulated as much in an address from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Saturday. He could not be \xe2\x80\x9clocked up in a room upstairs [trying to be] totally safe,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI had to be out there. This is America, this is the United States. . . . we have to confront problems. As a leader you have to confront problems.\xe2\x80\x9d The sentiment is exactly right. The effort in which we are currently engaging\xe2\x80\x94to \xe2\x80\x9cstay safe\xe2\x80\x9d from one particular risk at whatever cost\xe2\x80\x94is inimical to civilization. No matter Trump\xe2\x80\x99s medical outcome, the strength of our governing institutions will carry us through, thanks to the sacrifices of countless people over the centuries who were willing to risk everything, even to die, for the expansion of justice and freedom.Under today\xe2\x80\x99s safetyism mentality, sacrifice and risk-taking become unthinkable. The martial virtues of courage and stoicism have been sidelined and pathologized. When Trump briefly left Walter Reed on Sunday in a motorcade to greet supporters, a doctor at the hospital complained that the Secret Service agents in Trump\xe2\x80\x99s limousine \xe2\x80\x9cmight get sick. They may die.\xe2\x80\x9d These are the same Secret Service agents who are expected to take a bullet for a president. They were behind a plexiglass barrier in the car; all occupants were masked. Under our feminized ethos, showing resoluteness during a crisis, reassuring the public about one\xe2\x80\x99s well-being, are no longer positive traits in a leader; they are violations of maximal risk aversion. (Of course, medical information about a president\xe2\x80\x99s condition should be transparent.)Reopening is still the right policy. Mandatory outdoor mask-wearing is merely a way for government to turn citizens into walking billboards of fear, sending the false message that danger is everywhere. Infection rarely leads to death. Most of the infected recover. Given his governmental duties, the surprise is that Trump\xe2\x80\x94as president, another kind of front-line worker\xe2\x80\x94has not gotten sick before now.Last week, Trump gave a debate performance embodying what the Left likes to call toxic masculinity. Today, anticipating his departure from the hospital, Trump tweeted: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid of Covid. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let it dominate your life.\xe2\x80\x9d The mainstream media blew its top, calling the tweet \xe2\x80\x9cdangerous,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cgross,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9calmost impossible to believe.\xe2\x80\x9d Let them fume. Trump is now modelling masculine leadership at its best: upbeat, rational, and unbowed.Heather Mac Donald is the Thomas W.
