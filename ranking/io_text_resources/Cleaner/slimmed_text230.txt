There was no Federal Open Markets Committee meeting in August.\xe2\x80\x9cThe projected rate of recovery in real GDP, and the pace of declines in the unemployment rate, over the second half of this year were expected to be somewhat less robust than in the previous forecast,\xe2\x80\x9d the minutes from the July meeting said.The contrast can be seen in assessments of business investment and the labor market. At the July meeting,\xc2\xa0 Fed officials thought \xe2\x80\x9cemployment gains, which was quite strong in May and June, had likely slowed.\xe2\x80\x9dNow they see that although they had slowed they slowed much less than thought.\xe2\x80\x9cParticipants observed that labor market conditions continued to improve in recent months and that the economy through August had regained roughly half of the 22 million jobs that were lost in March and April. The gains in employment over July and August were generally seen as larger than anticipated,\xe2\x80\x9d the September minutes report.This positive turn in the economy is even more remarkable because it occured without the additional stimulus the minutes show Fed officials expected back in July. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, cases rose\xe2\x80\x94as Fed officials expected\xe2\x80\x94but this did not have as much of a drag on the economy as officials thought it would.Fed officials remain wary of the impact that pandemic could have on the economy if cases keep rising but they are no longer as worried about another nationwide shutdown.\xe2\x80\x9cWhile the risk of another broad economic shutdown was seen as having receded, participants remained concerned about the possibility of additional virus outbreaks that could undermine the recovery,\xe2\x80\x9d the latest minutes say.\xc2\xa0EconomyHealthcoronavirusFederal Reserve.Please let us know if you\'re having issues with commenting.SOCIALMOST POPULARBiden Blames Trump for Gretchen Whitmer Kidnap AttemptMI AG Nessel on Plot to Kidnap Gov: Trump\'s Rhetoric Command to ActionFacebook Censors New York Post, Protecting Biden From Bombshell StoryJack Dorsey Breaks Silence on Censorship, Admits Response \'Not Great\'Jane Fonda Says COVID-19 Is \'God\'s Gift to the Left\'Nancy Pelosi Plots to Remove Trump Using 25th AmendmentTommy Lee Says He Will Leave U.S. If Trump Re-ElectedFacebook &amp; Twitter Censor Biden Bombshells Weeks After Execs Join Team***Live Updates*** Vice Presidential Debate: Pence vs. HarrisWatch Live: President Donald Trump Holds a Campaign Rally in IowaFROM THE HOMEPAGESenate Judiciary Committee Will Subpoena Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey over NY Post CensorshipDonald Trump: \xe2\x80\x98Big Tech\xe2\x80\x99 Censoring the New York Post to Save Joe BidenCrew Member on Biden Campaign\xe2\x80\x99s Charter Plane Tests Positive for CoronavirusDonald Trump: Biden Family \xe2\x80\x98Corrupt as Hell\xe2\x80\x99 for Pursuing Deals in China100 Hollywood Celebrities Demand NBC Reschedule Trump Town Hall: \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t Give Trump a Ratings Win\xe2\x80\x99FCC Chairman Ajit Pai Backs Rulemaking to Reform Section 230C-SPAN Suspends Steve Scully Indefinitely After Admitting He Lied About Twitter HackExclusive\xe2\x80\x94Sen.
