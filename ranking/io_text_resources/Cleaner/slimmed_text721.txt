Most notably, the agency has asked drugmakers to submit a median of two months of follow-up from study participants in late-stage clinical trials.\xc2\xa0Dive Insight:The Trump administration has staked a lot to the speedy delivery of a coronavirus vaccine, pledging more than $10 billion to half a dozen drugmakers advancing experimental shots. Operation Warp Speed, the administration\'s vaccine project, has promised tens of millions of doses will be available before the end of this year and hundreds of millions by the middle of 2021.\xc2\xa0President Donald Trump, however, has repeatedly called for even more ambitious timelines, suggesting a vaccine could come sooner, perhaps before next month\'s election. His statements have ramped up pressure on the FDA and made the agency\'s planned requirements for an early approval the subject of a political battle between White House officials and regulators.\xc2\xa0On Monday evening, The New York Times and POLITICO both reported the White House had blocked the release of the FDA\'s guidelines, which Trump last month claimed without basis\xc2\xa0were politically motivated.\xc2\xa0The document posted Tuesday reveals the FDA already informed drugmakers of its standards for an emergency authorization and, by detailing what was communicated, accomplishes much of what the agency sought to do by releasing additional guidelines. Discussion of approval standards is typical between the FDA and drugmakers, even without the issuance of formal guidance.\xc2\xa0The FDA previously set out standards for a full approval of a coronavirus shot back in June, indicating clinical trial results would need to show a vaccine to be at least 50% effective in preventing COVID-19 or infection with SARS-CoV-2.\xc2\xa0Emergency use authorizations, or EUAs, usually require less evidence, although FDA officials have indicated a vaccine authorization would be more like an "EUA plus," given the potential for widespread use among healthy people.\xc2\xa0According to the new document, the FDA will still require proof an experimental vaccine is at least 50% effective for an emergency authorization. Additionally, the agency wants a median of two months of data from clinical trial participants following completion of vaccination, which for the leading candidates consists of two shots spaced three to four weeks apart.\xc2\xa0At least five cases of severe COVID-19 would need to be observed in the participants who have received a placebo, the FDA told drugmakers, in order to determine the risk of respiratory disease induced by vaccination \xe2\x80\x94 a key safety worry for both developers and regulators.These criteria were previously reported by The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, but weren\'t confirmed by the FDA.\xc2\xa0In the U.S., vaccines developed by Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca are the most advanced in testing, each having begun Phase 3 trials that are enrolling tens of thousands of participants. Moderna\'s chief executive, however, has said initial data aren\'t likely until late November, and AstraZeneca\'s study is currently on hold due to safety concerns raised by a case of neurological illness in a U.K.-based study.\xc2\xa0Pfizer, then, is the only developer with a chance to disclose data and ask the FDA for an EUA before Nov. 3. The company has enrolled 36,576 people into its principal study, and some 28,000 have since received their second shot.\xc2\xa0Trial plans made public by Pfizer last month show the independent committee overseeing the study can look at interim data four times \xe2\x80\x94 after 32, 62, 92 and 120 COVID-19 cases have been reported \xe2\x80\x94 with a primary analysis to follow at 164 cases.\xc2\xa0Albert Bourla, Pfizer\'s CEO, has said results from one of those early interim looks could come by late October. But it\'s unlikely that the drugmaker would have a median of two months of follow-up from all the individuals who have been dosed twice by that point.\xc2\xa0Additionally, an EUA would take the FDA "weeks" to go over, according to Peter Marks, head of the FDA division responsible for vaccine reviews.Marks, speaking Monday to JAMA editor Howard Bauchner in a webcast interview, noted, however, that the agency could be flexible on that two month standard."If it turns out the median is 7 weeks and not two months, that\'s not going to be an issue," he said.\xc2\xa0Still, with only 28 days before the election, Pfizer would need to disclose data and have submitted an EUA request to the FDA by next week at the latest for a pre-election approval to be possible.\xc2\xa0The document released Tuesday also notes the FDA asked developers to submit their manufacturing information "not less than one month" prior to an EUA application, meaning Pfizer would have needed to already share that data with regulators.In an emailed statement, Pfizer said it "will support and meet or exceed the standards for safety,\xc2\xa0efficacy, and manufacturing that the agency adopts." Moderna did not return BioPharma Dive\'s request for comment by publication.The FDA acknowledged in an email to BioPharma Dive the information contained in the document released Tuesday, but did not elaborate on whether it would stand in place of formal guidance.\xc2\xa0Editor\'s note: This article has been updated with comment from Pfizer.\xc2\xa0 Recommended Reading: The New York Times White House Blocks New Coronavirus Vaccine Guidelines POLITICO White House cited drug companies\xe2\x80\x99 objections in overruling FDA\xe2\x80\x99s vaccine standards Follow Ned Pagliarulo on Twitter share tweet post email print Filed Under: FDA Clinical Trials Editors\' picks Explore the Trendline\xe2\x9e\x94 Getty Images Trendline Gene Therapy Rapid scientific advances have put the gene therapy field at the forefront of biomedical research.
