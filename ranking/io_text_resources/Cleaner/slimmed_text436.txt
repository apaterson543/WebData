Until there is a victory, one way or the other, volatility is here to stay.\xc2\xa0The US dollar tends to thrive in volatility because such currencies, such as the euro, are hit at times of risk-off.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We saw this yesterday:\xc2\xa0The VIX, today, is down\xc2\xa04%, but yesterday it was up by some 8%.\xc2\xa0The US dollar is, therefore, negatively correlated to the VIX considering its gains yesterday and losses today.\xc2\xa0Until there is a clear outcome from the elections, the stock market is bound to be vulnerable to swings which should play into the hands of the US dollar bulls.\xc2\xa0Traditionally, the dollar has a track record of not doing so well leading into the elections, but these are unprecedented times.The coronavirus, trade wars, fiscal stimulus and the Fed are the main drivers during this election.Analysts at Rabobank explained that a Blue Wave would lead to a more substantial fiscal stimulus package that could support optimism about world growth and boost risk appetite.Key comments\'\'This environment may on first sight soften the USD though in the medium term downside could be limited by the coincident assumption that a large fiscal stimulus plan could remove pressure for increased monetary policy stimulus from the Fed.\'\'\'\'The impact of these factors on asset prices will also be dependent on the course of COVID-19 through the globe and by its associated economic restrictions.\'\'\'\'The current rise in the number of cases as the Northern Hemisphere faces its winter suggests that risk appetite could be contained in the coming months irrespective of the election outcome.\'\'DXY technical analysisIn the analysis from the end of last week,\xc2\xa0DXY Price Analysis: EM-FX/DXY could be a tell-tale sign of things to come,\xc2\xa0a case was made for a higher dollar.The chart above offers a scenario that complexes a 5-Wave analysis:The chart below is a longer-term view based on a bullish reverse head and shoulders pattern.Meanwhile, bulls need the 93.40/50s to hold with the price stationed outside of the channel.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Information on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
