Apple and Google on Wednesday, May 20, 2020, released long-awaited smartphone technology to automatically notify people if they might have been exposed to the coronavirus. (AP Photo/File) By: Associated Press Posted at 3:29 PM, Oct 06, 2020 and last updated 2020-10-06 17:29:39-04 DENVER (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 The release of a mobile application that would notify Colorado residents if they were close to a person who tested positive for COVID-19 has been delayed so state officials can work with Google and Apple.Democratic Gov. Jared Polis said at the beginning of September that the Exposure Notification Express application would be available by the end of the month, the Denver Post reported. It is now unclear when the app would be available for use.The app would create \xe2\x80\x9ctokens\xe2\x80\x9d that it would exchange through Bluetooth with nearby phones that also have the program running. Health officials say if someone tests positive they would be given a code to put into the app, and anyone who was within six feet for 10 minutes or longer would be notified of potential exposure, but not identify from who.The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said they are working with the governor\xe2\x80\x99s office of information technology and the two tech giants to make sure the application aligns with public health guidelines and meets the state\xe2\x80\x99s technological functioning criteria.The application is not yet functioning but Android users can download it to their devices and Apple users can opt in to have it automatically download when it becomes available, officials said.
