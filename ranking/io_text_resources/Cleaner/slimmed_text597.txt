Everything from government related scams, shmishing campaigns, and most commonly, email phishing attempts, are taking advantage of vulnerable people during a fearful time. Phishing scams aren\xe2\x80\x99t new to most, however, the pandemic has brought out even more relentless cybercriminals and new tactics to trick those into clicking links and potentially giving up their credentials. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today we will focus on the coronavirus related phishing scams and how to differentiate a scam from a real email.How to Protect AgainstCOVID-19 Cyber ScamsAs attacks become more challenging to identify, organizations become more susceptible to breach and ransomware infections are often instigated through phishing emails. It\xe2\x80\x99s crucial to take proactive measures to help protect yourself and your organization\xe2\x80\x99s security.Coronavirus related phishing attempts are a current security attack trend with the ultimate goal of loading dangerous malware on an innocent individual\xe2\x80\x99s computer. Cybercriminals send emails claiming to be from legitimate organizations, such as the World Health Organization or the CDC, with information about the coronavirus \xc2\xa0The suspect email may ask you to download an attachment or click a link to review the latest statistics. You should know that if the link is clicked, or the attachment was downloaded, you have potentially loaded malicious software onto your device. This malware could allow cybercriminals to take full control of your computer, log your keystrokes, and even access your personal information and financial data. A legitimate organization, such as the WHO, will likely never ask you to download an attachment you have not requested. They will never ask for your username/password or offer you money. If you receive an email including any of these items, you may be the target of a coronavirus phishing attack. The best way to prevent the potentially damaging effects of phishing attacks is enforcing basic education \xe2\x80\x93 just like putting on your seat belt when driving a car. By now you\xe2\x80\x99re probably pretty familiar with what the typical phishing email looks like, and what to watch out for, however here\xe2\x80\x99s a quick reminder:What to look for in a traditional phishing email:Verify that the email address is really an internal address and from a trusted sourceIf your name is not in the to: or CC: line or many of your colleagues are listed (dozens or even hundreds), question the sourceIf there are simple typos or grammatical mistakes, or the subject line seems odd, it could potentially be a fakeVerify the links are for real domains and not questionable like .ruSourceDo\xe2\x80\x99s and Don\xe2\x80\x99ts When You Receive aPossible Phishing EmailDon\xe2\x80\x99t ever give out sensitive information such as your username/password, financial information, or addressDon\xe2\x80\x99t feel pressured to click the link or download an attachment because of a \xe2\x80\x9cdeadline\xe2\x80\x9d outlined in the emailDo your research \xe2\x80\x93 most organizations will issue a statement regarding phishing emails or scams coming from a source that appears to be them. Always check the website of the organization to verify Always report the scam to the organization in question and to your organization\xe2\x80\x99s IT teamIf you mistakenly gave out sensitive information to a scammer, make sure to change all your passwords immediately5 Best Practices to Mitigate theRisks of Phishing AttacksBasic technology can stop anattack even if the end user makes a mistake since many of the phishing attacksleverage known weaknesses. Here are five best practices to mitigate the risksof phishing attacks:Make sure all security patches are up to date on a regular basis for all systems, especially for common attack vectors like Microsoft Office, Adobe Flash, and Java.Ensure the end-user is running with proper privileges and not logged in as an administrator answering emails. This just makes it easier for malware to own the system and bypass defences.Ensure defence software like AV is up to date including engine and signatures.Disable automatic macro execution in Office and only run macros that are digitally signed (the sample file discussed above).Deploy and maintain SPAM filters, next-generation firewalls, etc. to stop malicious emails before they end up in an end user\xe2\x80\x99s inbox and establish command and control of the hijacked system.Interested in learning moreabout how to improve your email security practices?
