One reason people will avoid getting their flu shot? Seventeen percent say they\xe2\x80\x99re concerned about potential exposure to COVID-19 if they go out to get vaccinated.AdvertisementWhat it means to HR leadersFlu vaccines are always important, but especially this year as COVID-19 wreaks havoc on employees\xe2\x80\x99 health. \xe2\x80\x9cNow more than ever, during the COVID-19 pandemic, flu vaccination is critical not only to protect yourself, your loved ones and your community (especially those who are most vulnerable, like children, adults age 65-plus and individuals with certain chronic health conditions), but also to reduce potential strain on the U.S. healthcare system,\xe2\x80\x9d the foundation says.Employers and HR managers often encourage flu vaccines for employees, but this year it is vital for them to do so, experts say.\xe2\x80\x9cIt is important employers do their part to encourage employees to receive a flu shot,\xe2\x80\x9d says Chaz Hinkle, chief people officer of Welltok. \xe2\x80\x9cStudies show that getting vaccinated can reduce flu illness, doctors\xe2\x80\x99 visits and missed work and school, as well as prevent flu-related hospitalizations. Influenza vaccination is particularly important for older people, pregnant women, people who are immuno-compromised and others with chronic conditions who are at risk for serious cases of, and complications from, the flu, as this is the same group of people more vulnerable for hospitalization due to severe illness from COVID-19 infection.\xe2\x80\x9dRelated: 4 tips to encourage employees to get a flu shotAdvertisementHR can encourage employees to get their flu shots in a number of ways. Some ideas? Using a variety of communication and reminders (including messaging around open enrollment), offering drive-through flu shot clinics, and providing rewards and incentives, including gift cards, vacation time or flexible hours, for getting their flu shots.
