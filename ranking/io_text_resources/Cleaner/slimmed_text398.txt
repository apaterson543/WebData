Entrepreneurs have personal savings that barely last for a few months even for themselves. So, they can\xe2\x80\x99t pay salaries to employees which compels them to fire their existing employees from jobs. Fortunately, there are many financial resources available that can help them to combat such a crisis.Small businesses are the backbone of any country\xe2\x80\x99s economy, including the U.S. Nearly half of the population in the U.S work or own small businesses. Karen G. Mills, a senior fellow at Harvard Business School and former administrator of the U.S. The Small Business Administration said, \xe2\x80\x9cHalf the people who work in this country own or work for a small business. So that\xe2\x80\x99s half of our jobs,\xe2\x80\x9dAfter the markets and public places deserted due to COVID-19 impact, business owners are suffering huge losses. Their little savings are no more effective to keep with a wide range of payments to survive. According to the Harvard Business Review, franchising is bound to lose 26,500 small businesses due to coronavirus outbreak alone. Brick and mortar businesses such as restaurants have to spend heavily on high overhead costs. They need to spend money on rent, taxes, fixtures, dept, utilities, service contracts, payroll, insurance, and other things. Many such businesses are forced to take unwanted hard steps such as laying off staff.But, fortunately, government and private companies, individuals, and organizations have come forward to help small businesses with funds and other kinds of assistance.Here Is The Key List Of Financial Resources That Small Businesses Can Explore To Beat Such Crisis Without Affecting The Most Valuable Assets Called Employees 01. Get The Federal Government LoanThe U.S federal government has created a relief package under its new Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. The Act created a $350 billion loan program to provide financial assistance to small businesses with fewer than 500 employees. These employees include self-employed, sole proprietors, and independent contractors. With the loan, a small business can meet expenses toward payroll, utilities, insurance premiums, etc. Such businesses can get a loan assistance of up to $10 million.The federal government has responded by offering tax relief to small businesses. They can get employee retention tax credit. They also are eligible for a refundable 50% tax credit on wages up to $10, 000 per employee. 02. Find Out Loans From Your CitiesNot only the federal government, but your city might also be providing loans to small businesses. For instance, New York was planning to offer interest-free loans to the businesses reeling under the crisis. Those businesses having fewer than 100 employees will be offered loans.Then, some cities are offering grants of up to $6000 for businesses that had fewer than five employees. Such loans are also available to the freelancers from their Small Business Administration office. 03.
