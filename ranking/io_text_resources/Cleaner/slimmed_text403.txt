Date 18 Sep 2020 Category Forensic Accounting High Court hands down it\xe2\x80\x99s judgement in the FCA test case for COVID business interruption claims. The test case was brought about by the FCA to bring clarity, after some insurers said that their business interruption insurance policies would not cover COVID-19 claims.In a statement the FCA said that the court ruling said that in most cases the disease clause wording in the test case provided cover for the policyholder.\xc2\xa0 The FCA did say however, \xe2\x80\x98that the judgement did not say that the eight defendant insurers are liable across all of the 21 different types of policy wording in the sample considered in court, each policy would need to be considered against the detailed judgement to work out what it means to that policy\xe2\x80\x99.Martin Chapman, Partner, Forensic Azets, commented: \'As a result of this decision we can expect insurance companies to tighten future policy wording and increase premiums.\'This will no doubt make it more difficult for companies to get the business interruption insurance cover they want and increase the price of their insurance.\xc2\xa0\'The benefit of the decision is it gives many struggling companies a lifeline that could potentially see them through the current crisis, which will support jobs and investment.\'Optioning for a test case was the only real option to settle the matter. It saved business and the courts vast amounts of time, as well as unnecessary cost, by avoiding the need for individual litigation.\'It has greatly accelerated the whole process, meaning any pay-out is achieved while the insured remains a going concern.Although, this is a great result for Policy Holders, we wait to see how the Insurers react to this outcome and whether an appeal may happen. I hope this isn\xe2\x80\x99t the case so a clear line of direction is kept in these already uncertain times.\xe2\x80\x9dhttps://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/result-fca-business-interruption-test-caseWhat should you do next?Review your policy to see if you are eligible to claim.If you have already made a claim that was rejected prior to this case, you may be able to resubmit your claim.Check to see if you are covered for any additional extras such as professional servicesIf you need any help with your business interruption claim please contact the Forensic Accounting team - forensic@azets.co.uk About the author Martin Chapman Partner Birmingham View profile View all news &amp; insights Related content Forensic Accounting You might also be interested in HMRC to target Covid-19 fraudulent claims 22 Sep 2020 Tax | Fraud Investigation | Tax Disputes | HMRC | Fraud investigations | tax investigations Business Interruption Insurance Claims: All is not lost\xe2\x80\xa6but challenges to overcome 23 Jun 2020 Forensic Accounting | COVID-19 Get to know us Find an office About us Careers News &amp; insights Website policies Modern Slavery Act Statement Legal &amp; Regulatory Information Privacy and cookie policy Terms of use Accessibility Contact us Request a call back Contact a local office Get to know us Copyright \xc2\xa9 Azets 2020, All rights reserved.
