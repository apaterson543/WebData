Getty ImagesCOVID-19 survivors are experiencing an array of symptoms, including hair loss, dizziness, chest pain, and extreme fatigue.In the emergency room at Harborview Medical Center, physicians such as Kelli O\xe2\x80\x99Laughlin are seeing former COVID-19 patients with persistent\xc2\xa0fatigue and shortness of breath and symptoms so severe they are returning to the hospital.While much has been learned about the virus since it was first detected, the long-term effects on the health of coronavirus survivors may take years to understand.O\xe2\x80\x99Laughlin, assistant professor of emergency medicine and global health at the University of Washington School of Medicine, is part of a team at UW Medicine and partners across the country launching a nationwide study of patients who are infected.The study known as INSPIRE (Innovative Support for Patients with SARS COV-2 Infections Registry) is tracking 4,800 individuals to assess the outcomes of infections on various age groups over a two-year period.\xe2\x80\x9cWe want to understand the long-term effects of COVID-19 and the ongoing impact it has on people\'s lives,\xe2\x80\x9d O\xe2\x80\x99Laughlin said.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention awarded $13.7 the investigators million.\xc2\xa0 UW researchers in family medicine and emergency medicine received $8.2 million of that amount to lead the clinical core,\xc2\xa0following people who tested positive for COVID over time to understand their symptoms and persistence of symptoms. They are partnering with\xc2\xa0Rush University in Chicago, Yale New Haven Health,\xc2\xa0the University of Texas in Houston and Southwestern, the University of California in Los Angeles and San Francisco, and Thomas Jefferson University\xc2\xa0in Philadelphia.Already, news accounts are coming out of COVID-19 survivors experiencing hair loss, dizziness, ear popping, laryngitis, and chest pain. Uniformly, the survivors complain of extreme fatigue. A 39-year-old woman quoted in the New York Times said she needs to mentally prep for a shower because she is so exhausted.The patients wrestling with an array of ongoing symptoms are known as \xe2\x80\x9clong-haulers\xe2\x80\x9d and could be in the thousands. A New York Times story Sept. 28, 2020, said by some estimates 1 in 3 COVID-19 survivors have lingering symptoms.Physicians are puzzled as to how to help long-haulers.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cWe are still trying to understand which lingering symptoms are to be expected, how long they will remain and what is causing them,\xe2\x80\x9d said O\xe2\x80\x99Laughlin.Nikki Gentile, a UW acting assistant professor of family medicine, said primary care physicians are seeing a rise of long-haulers as well.\xe2\x80\x9cWe are seeing a lot of previously healthy, active patients presenting to primary care clinics with shortness of breath, fatigue, decreased exercise tolerance, diminished sense of taste or smell, and/or new or worsening anxiety or depression several weeks, or even months post-COVID-19 infection,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.Recruitment for the study began Oct. 1\xc2\xa0for 3,600 COVID-19 cases and 1,200 control subjects. INSPIRE will gather information through ongoing surveys. A community advisory board made up of participants and researchers will be helping to oversee the study.\xe2\x80\x9cThis disease will be with us for years to come and understanding the impact on the health of survivors will be essential to our understanding of how to treat it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bala Hota, chief analytics officer at Rush and an infectious disease expert.\xe2\x80\x93 Bobbi Nodell, bnodell@uw.edu, 206.543.7129Category:\xc2\xa0ResearchTags:\xc2\xa0emergency medicinefamily medicinecoronavirus Latest posts October 13, 2020 Some youth sports resume this season, but not all October 7, 2020 Studying why Black men face grim prostate cancer outcomes October 5, 2020 Researchers investigating long-term effects of COVID-19 September 30, 2020 Secret ingredient in new diabetes guideline: patient POV September 25, 2020 Ground broken in Spokane for med school partnership More &gt; Contact Contact UsDirectionsSubscribe News News ReleasesBlogMedia Coverage Multimedia VideosPhotos About About UW MedicineAbout NewsroomPractices &amp; Policies Social Media TwitterRss Feed Other UW Medicine channels Copyright 2020\xc2\xa0University of Washington | Seattle |\xc2\xa0All rights reserved | Privacy\xc2\xa0&amp; Terms\xc2\xa0 '
