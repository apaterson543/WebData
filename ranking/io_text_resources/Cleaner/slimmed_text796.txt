The patio at the restaurant was almost full on this warm fall day, but when temperatures drop, eating outside is going to become more of a challenge. (Eddie Moore/Albuquerque Journal)Copyright \xc2\xa9 2020 Albuquerque JournalSANTA FE \xe2\x80\x93 The patio at Cowgirl BBQ was crowded Friday afternoon \xe2\x80\x93 as much as legally possible \xe2\x80\x93 as owner Patrick Lambert went from table to table.Lambert\xe2\x80\x99s restaurant, a popular destination in downtown Santa Fe, for the most part has been able to stave off closure during the COVID-19 pandemic \xe2\x80\x93 unlike many other eateries in New Mexico.ADVERTISEMENTSkip................................................................\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re doing better than most, but our business is 60% off,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lambert, who did have to shut down the restaurant for a few days in July after a worker tested positive for the virus.That mild success is due in large part to Cowgirl\xe2\x80\x99s large patio spaces, which Lambert can keep at 75% capacity as opposed to the 25% mandated for indoor patrons.But he and many other restaurant owners remain worried, as the looming cold weather threatens to wipe out any modest gains that outdoor dining has provided.That threat is especially apparent in tourism-reliant areas such as Santa Fe.\xe2\x80\x9cThe colder season is the slow season in Santa Fe, anyhow,\xe2\x80\x9d Lambert said, adding that many restaurants rely on outdoor areas to make ends meet.Many businesses did not even survive Santa Fe\xe2\x80\x99s traditionally busy tourism season \xe2\x80\x93 88 businesses in the city closed from March to August, including restaurants, according to city records.The downtown location of one of those restaurants, L\xe2\x80\x99Olivier, has already been filled by The Pantry\xe2\x80\x99s third location, which opened for the first time Friday. The Pantry co-owner Stan Singley said he had hoped he could seat more people indoors on opening day.\xe2\x80\x9cI was disappointed to see that COVID numbers were up,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI was halfway anticipating us being able to maybe go to 50% on the interior.\xe2\x80\x9dRestaurants in Albuquerque are anticipating similar struggles, with some not sure how they\xe2\x80\x99ll survive if they can\xe2\x80\x99t seat people outdoors.Chris Medina, owner of Holy Burger near Downtown, said he\xe2\x80\x99s considering hiring an architect to design a new outdoor space suited for colder weather, but he\xe2\x80\x99s worried the cost could be prohibitive.\xe2\x80\x9cI know it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be cheap,\xe2\x80\x9d Medina said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have six weeks before (the weather) really hits us. So it\xe2\x80\x99s a little stressful.\xe2\x80\x9dCarol Wight, CEO of the New Mexico Restaurant Association, said owners across the state are worried freezing temperatures will drive away what little business they\xe2\x80\x99ve mustered.\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine that I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna want to go outdoor dining when it\xe2\x80\x99s 40 degrees,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.She said some eateries have considered investing in expensive tents to maintain temperatures, which can cost upward of $4,000 a month.Patrick Lambert, co-owner of the Cowgirl BBQ in Santa Fe, gets contact tracing information from a customer on the restaurant\xe2\x80\x99s patio. (Eddie Moore/Albuquerque Journal)However, restrictions currently say a space can only be considered \xe2\x80\x9coutdoor dining\xe2\x80\x9d if it has at least three open sides, making it difficult to regulate temperatures.Other places are stocking up on space heaters for patio areas, causing a shortage for heaters in stores across the country, according to Slate. Cherie Montoya of Farm &amp; Table in Albuquerque\xe2\x80\x99s North Valley anticipated the demand and stocked a month and a half ago.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s kind of scary,\xe2\x80\x9d Montoya said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe want to keep our customers in a comfortable outdoor space as long as possible.\xe2\x80\x9dRestaurateurs expect a brutal winter for their businesses, especially if indoor dining capacities remain unchanged and the federal government does not provide any more financial assistance.\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be a massive downward spiral in revenue,\xe2\x80\x9d said Andy Razatos, general manager of the Plaza Caf\xc3\xa9, on Santa Fe\xe2\x80\x99s historic Plaza.Razatos and Lambert said a sizable reduction in outdoor diners would likely result in staffing reductions, unless other aid is provided.Wight said she\xe2\x80\x99s hoping the Legislature appropriates money for restaurants during the next session, which starts in January.Wight also said she thought the state should increase the percentage of customers allowed to eat inside, because other states have fewer restrictions.Nora Meyers Sackett, spokeswoman for the Governor\xe2\x80\x99s Office, wrote in a statement that restaurants are not inherently dangerous but that having a lot of people without masks in an enclosed area can further the spread of coronavirus.Lambert said he would not mind increasing his indoor dining capacity \xe2\x80\x93 if the science says it\xe2\x80\x99s OK.\xe2\x80\x9cIf the environment allows it, by all means,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.Subscribe now!
