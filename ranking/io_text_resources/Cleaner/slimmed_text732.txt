(Submitted photo)They decided to co-write and publish a book, \xe2\x80\x9cSchool Is Different This Year And That\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s OK!\xe2\x80\x9d in mid-August. The writing process was long distance because Leininger lives in Noblesville and Bair in Mason, Ohio.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThrough lots of FaceTime, phone calls and texts, we put our nervous energy into the creativity about making the right decision and going through the process,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Leininger said. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWe turned our emotions into inspiration of creativity by creating a story about silly ducks and goats navigating through both in-school and remote-learning experiences with a positive perspective. It teaches kids (that) families make different decisions for different reasons and kind of overcoming all those uncertainties.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9dThe characters were inspired by the sisters\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99 farm animals. Leininger got four goats during quarantine and Bair got chickens. The sisters found an illustrator, Claudio Icuza, in Argentina.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThe greatest challenge was the physical distance that we had with him and each other, and then the timing,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Leininger said. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWe had the idea to write the book on July 17, and in less than 30 days we wrote, illustrated and self-published the book. The timing was critical to the book success, we thought.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9dMore than 10,000 books sold in the first five weeks, Leininger said. It had a top-20 ranking for quickest growth in Amazon U.S. and reached No. 1 for new releases for children\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s animal books on Amazon U.S. It also made the Top 20 Most Sold and Read Books of the Week for Amazon charts in Canada.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIt\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s really surprised us,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Leininger said. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWe were having fun being creative and bonding. When it came out, we only saw one other kids\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99 COVID book, and now there is over 30.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9dBair said the most challenging part was writing their first book in under 30 days.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cGiven the timely nature of the subject, speed was important,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Bair said. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWe learned a lot through the process and had a lot of fun doing it together.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9dIt has convinced the sisters to write \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cCelebrations Are Different This Year And That\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s OK!.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Leininger said the book shares a positive message of how celebrations were certainly different in 2020, but many good and new moments were also created.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 It also encourages a spirit of giving and helping others.Leninger, 40, and Bair, 44, share the same March 23 birthday. The goat in the book wears a baseball jersey with the number 23.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThey\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99re super social,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Leininger said of her four goats. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99ve brought them with me when I\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99ve read at school. The kids love when I bring the main characters with me.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9dLeininger and her husband, Ryan, have three children, Danielle, 12, Ella, 9 and Nolan, 7. Each attends Our Lady of Grace at Noblesville. Bair also has three children.The book is available on\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0amazon.com.Stay CURRENT with our daily newsletter (M-F) and breaking news alerts delivered to your inbox for free!Email (required) *First Name Select list(s) to subscribe toMorning BriefingEntertainmentFood/DiningBreaking News Yes, I would like to receive emails from Current Publishing.
