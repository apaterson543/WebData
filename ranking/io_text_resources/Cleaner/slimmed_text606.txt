It\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s hoped that this method will see the vaccine directly targeting the cells lining the airways, which is the typical point of infection for respiratory viruses. In doing so, the vaccine may induce a more effective immune response against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.For each vaccine, researchers will assess three dose levels (low, medium and high dose) with three volunteers per group (18 in total), followed by an additional six in each group at the best dose (12 total).If effective, the development of vaccines against Covid-19 could be potentially accelerated due to the possible additional delivery methods and targets.Dr Chris Chiu, from the\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Department of Infectious Disease, and lead on the project, said: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWe have evidence that delivering influenza vaccines via a nasal spray can protect people against flu as well as help to reduce the transmission of the disease. We are keen to explore if this may also be the case for SARS-CoV-2 and whether delivering Covid-19 vaccines to the respiratory tract is safe and produces an effective immune response.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9dAs most people know, SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory virus which \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cinfects people through the cells lining the nose, throat and lungs,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Dr Chiu explained, but it is these surfaces within the body that \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cproduce a different immune response to the rest of the body.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d That\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s why the team are exploring if targeting the airways directly can provide a more effective response compared to a traditional injected vaccine.Dr Chiu will work alongside Imperial\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s professor Robin Shattock and Oxford\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s professor Sarah Gilbert on the project.In addition to blood being analysed for the presence of neutralising antibodies (Immunoglobulin G, or IgG) and T cells, which fight the virus and protect against re-infection, the team will analyse nasal samples for the presence of specialised antibodies found in the nose and throat, called IgA, which would indicate a more specialised and localised immune response to the virus.Professor Robin Shattock, from Imperial\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s Department of Infectious Disease and research lead on the Imperial vaccine, said: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cA number of groups around the world are currently working on clinical trials for Covid-19 vaccines, and these will tell us whether these candidates can produce a systemic immune response against the virus. However, these trials are unlikely to tell us anything about the localised response in the nose, throat and airways \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x93 where the virus primarily attacks and invades cells.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cIt may well be that one group has the right vaccine but the wrong delivery method, and only trials such as this will be able to tell us that. We look forward to assessing different delivery methods and pushing forward the global scientific effort against this virus.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9dProfessor Sarah Gilbert, from the University of Oxford, said: \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWe have already shown that ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) is safe and induces strong immune responses after intramuscular injection. Delivering the vaccine to the respiratory tract instead may be a good approach to inducing immune responses in the best place to enable a rapid response after exposure to airborne virus. This is a small study which will provide some important information.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Back to Search Results Tags Covid-19 Imperial College London (ICL) Oxford University ChAdOx1 15 September 2020 09:30 Home News Opinion Digital Health Analysis Technology Latest Issue Webinars Directory Subscribe About Us Advertise Contact Us Terms &amp; Conditions Privacy Policy \xc3\x82\xc2\xa9 2020 Rapid Life Sciences Ltd, a Rapid News Group Company.
