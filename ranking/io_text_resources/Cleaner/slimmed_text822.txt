They are intended to be short, sharp action to arrest a worrying increase in infection.\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, although they are temporary, they are needed.\xe2\x80\x9cWithout them, there is a risk the virus will be out of control by the end of this month.\xe2\x80\x9dSupport the Tele today.The Tele is Dundee Born and Read, and is committed to providing news to our communities.
