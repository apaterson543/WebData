(Win McNamee/Getty Images/TNS)Photo: Win McNamee, TNS Continuing to blur the line between political campaign and suicide cult, President Trump took to multiple outlets to urge his remaining followers not to be \xe2\x80\x9cafraid\xe2\x80\x9d of the coronavirus or \xe2\x80\x9clet it dominate\xe2\x80\x9d them but rather to \xe2\x80\x9cbeat it.\xe2\x80\x9d He did so after discharging himself from Walter Reed National Medical Military Center hospital and returning to the White House to doff his mask for yet another dangerous and bizarre photo op. Many politicians lack the imagination to grasp issues until they personally experience them. Trump is that rarer specimen whose ignorance has not only survived his experience but somehow been deepened by it. The president called his illness a \xe2\x80\x9cschool\xe2\x80\x9d where he \xe2\x80\x9clearned a lot about COVID\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 at long last \xe2\x80\x94 but he flunked the final. The lesson Trump thinks he learned does not take into account his access to treatments that are unavailable or scarce for other patients as well as a level of care that is atypical of the American health care system he is obsessed with further undermining. And as even his obsequious military doctor suggested, the president himself has yet to safely emerge from the period when many similar cases suddenly become life-threatening. But Trump\xe2\x80\x99s latest misbegotten medical advice is most monstrous in its disdain for the more than 200,000 Americans lost to the virus, the countless others suffering lasting effects and the families devastated as a result. Now they must endure the added insult of their president implying that their personal weakness is to blame. In fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s the president\xe2\x80\x99s failures that have needlessly amplified the disaster. Look no further than his White House, which has become a coronavirus hot spot linked to a score of infections without any apparent administration effort at responsible contact tracing. In spite of unparalleled diagnostic and other resources, Trump lacked the will or competence to protect himself, his household, his workplace and his government, much less his country, from the contagion. California Sen. Kamala Harris will no doubt draw attention to that in her debate with Vice President Mike Pence Wednesday night. As of the day before, the campaigns were mired in a preliminary debate over whether Pence would accept the plexiglass safety barriers recommended by the debate commission. Given that this is coming from the chairman of the White House\xe2\x80\x99s coronavirus task force, we should be very afraid indeed.
