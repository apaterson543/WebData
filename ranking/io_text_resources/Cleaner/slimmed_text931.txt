Main Content WIRED Opinion There is no \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x98scientific divide\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99 over herd immunity There\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s a lot of talk of scientists divided over Covid-19, but when you look at the evidence any so-called divide starts to evaporate By Matt Reynolds 07 Oct 2020 Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Email By Matt Reynolds Wednesday 7 October 2020 Marco Bottigelli via Getty Images / WIRED On October 4, in a wood-panelled room at an event hosted by a libertarian think tank, three scientists signed a document that they say offers an alternative way of responding to the Covid-19 pandemic. The signing of this so-called \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cGreat Barrington Declaration\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d was greeted with clinking champagne glasses before the signatories jetted off to Washington DC on the invite of White House coronavirus advisor Scott Atlas.Aside from the three lead signatories, there is little about the Great Barrington Declaration that feels convincingly scientific. Not its website, which boasts that the statement has been signed by 2,780 \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cMedical and Public Health Scientists\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d who only had to tick a box and enter a name to be included on that list. Nor the brief declaration itself, which offers little in the way of scientific evidence or even substantially new policy suggestions. Advertisement While the science isn\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t particularly convincing, the Great Barrington Declaration has been successful in one respect. It suggests that scientists fall into two camps: those who are pro-lockdown and those who think we should avoid lockdowns and allow people to become infected, hopefully building up enough herd immunity along the way. The media has picked up on this narrative of a supposed rift among scientists and has run with it, while simultaneously declaring that no one is talking about it. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9c[The Great Barrington Declaration] has been almost entirely ignored by the media outlets that spend much of their days presenting themselves as obedient to science,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d wrote James Freeman in the Wall Street Journal on October 6, the same day that stories about the statement ran in The Guardian, Independent and Telegraph and ignoring the fact that articles about this supposed divide have been bubbling along for almost as long as the pandemic.So how much of a divide is there? Let\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s leave to one side the fact \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x93 as Christina Pagel, director of University College London\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s Clinical Operational Research Unit noted on Twitter \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x93 that almost every single major medical body is on the \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cside\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d of not allowing Covid-19 to run unrestrained through young people. Instead, let\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s look at the substance of the Great Barrington Declaration itself. Read next Without the daily commute, there is nothing to stop us burning out Without the daily commute, there is nothing to stop us burning out By Bruce Daisley The gist of the declaration is this: lockdown policies have significant negative effects on other health outcomes, and so governments should pursue a strategy that the signatories call Focused Protection \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x93 shielding vulnerable people from infection while letting the virus romp through the rest of the population.On the first point, the signatories are absolutely right. We know that lockdowns disrupt cancer care and other health services, and have a significant negative impact on mental health. No one wants those outcomes. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cCurrent lockdown policies are producing devastating effects on short and long-term public health,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d the authors write. And they\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99re correct. Almost. Advertisement The problem is that we aren\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t in lockdown. Across the UK, pubs, restaurants, schools and universities are all largely open. The kind of lockdown that the Great Barrington Declaration seems to be railing against hasn\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t been in place in the UK since mid-June. Even in places like Manchester which are under local lockdown restrictions, pubs, restaurants and schools are still open and it\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s hard to find people who are advocating for a return to the lockdown we saw in March. When the Great Barrington Declaration authors declare their opposition to lockdowns, they are quite literally arguing with the past.So what do the Great Barrington Declaration authors suggest we should be doing? \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cSimple hygiene measures, such as hand washing and staying home when sick should be practiced by everyone to reduce the herd immunity threshold. Schools and universities should be open for in-person teaching. Extracurricular activities, such as sports, should be resumed. Young low-risk adults should work normally, rather than from home. Restaurants and other businesses should open,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d they write. Sound familiar? These are \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x93 more or less \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x93 the policies that the UK government has been following since September, with the exception that the government advice changed in mid-September that people should work from home if they can.What is more interesting about the Great Barrington Declaration is what is missing. There is nothing about test and trace or mask-wearing \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x93 two interventions that we know are effective at stopping the spread of Covid-19 and don\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t require any curtailing of our individual behaviour. It\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s not clear why these are absent from this plan, but it might be because they would slow the spread of the virus, while the authors of the declaration generally advocate that slowing the spread upon less vulnerable populations is not necessary, as long as vulnerable people are shielded. Read next Forget Darpa. The British military is far too slow in embracing tech Forget Darpa. The British military is far too slow in embracing tech By Chris Deverell and Daniel Korski This is where things start to feel really wobbly. For a start, we don\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t know enough about Covid-19 immunity to say that having the disease does offer long-term protection. But even more crucially it\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s not clear who exactly the authors mean by \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cvulnerable\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d. Yes, older people are at a significantly higher risk of getting seriously ill or dying after contracting Covid-19, but the illness has a very serious impact on people across all age ranges. Just ask the people who are suffering months after initially falling ill with the lingering symptoms of Long Covid. Are they vulnerable? Advertisement Yet the authors don\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t offer us any way of categorising vulnerable or non-vulnerable people. Many scientists have pointed out that completely shielding vulnerable people is practically impossible, but the Great Barrington Declaration authors don\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t even make an effort to indicate how this shielding might work. In a video interview with UnHerd, Jay Bhattacharya a professor at Stanford University Medical School and one of the declaration\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s authors, struggled to explain how a school age child living with a grandparent should actually change their behaviour to protect people.It seems fairly obvious that no government could effectively seal off every single vulnerable person in a given population, yet the Great Barrington Declaration signatories don\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t indicate how the impact of the disease will change depending on the level of shielding achieved. Researchers at the Max Planck Institute in Germany have, however, and they concluded that long-term shielding would be impossible for a number of reasons outlined here. But the media reports about this great \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cscientific divide\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d are right about one thing. The lead signatories are prominent, successful scientists. Martin Kulldorff is a professor of medicine at Harvard University, Sunetra Gupta a professor at Oxford University and Jay Bhattacharay a professor at Stanford University Medical School. So why are they relying on press releases and champagne-clinking events with libertarian think tanks rather than following the scientific method of testing their hypotheses in a rigorous way and publishing their findings for critique?A quick look at the preprint server medRxiv shows that these three lead signatories have been publishing papers related to Covid-19, but they haven\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x93 to the best of my knowledge \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x93 published any modelling that puts their shielding theory to the test. In May, Gupta published a study suggesting that coronavirus may have infected half of the UK population already. She was wrong \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x93 in London the proportion of those infected seems to be close to 18 per cent \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x93 but that\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s how science works. You allow your results to be scrutinised, you adjust and you try and get closer to the truth next time. With this declaration, the three lead signatories are positioning themselves on one side of a manufactured scientific debate, but they\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99re not putting the science front and centre at all.

We should be careful about how we interpret any so-called divide when it comes to Covid-19. And when we\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99re weighing up whether one approach is better than another, we should be extremely clear about what is science, what is supposition and what is just surface.Matt Reynolds is WIRED\'s science editor.
