But in these cases -- some involving companies worth millions -- the agency hasn\'t proposed a single penalty greater than $30,000 for coronavirus-related risks.AdvertisementWith U.S. coronavirus deaths climbing above 200,000, Democrats and labor groups have been hammering the federal government to step up its enforcement, pushing for stricter safety rules and tougher penalties for bad actors.But Trump\'s regulators are taking a more relaxed approach than even previous Republican administrations when using their special enforcement powers to punish companies who expose workers to the virus. Republicans and business lobbying groups, including the Chamber of Commerce, have lined up against the establishment of a strict coronavirus standard, arguing that employers need flexibility during the pandemic.Just last month, OSHA levied its first citations against the meatpacking industry for coronavirus workplace safety risks, fining two of the world\'s largest meat companies, Smithfield and JBS Foods, roughly $29,000 combined after at least 12 workers died and almost 1,500 became infected at their plants.The fines sparked an uproar from worker advocacy groups, one of whom called the penalties a \xe2\x80\x9cslap on the wrist\xe2\x80\x9d to the giant companies.\xe2\x80\x9cEvery enforcement action sends a message,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. David Michaels, who led OSHA under the Obama administration. \xe2\x80\x9cThese tiny fines are OSHA sending a message to meat factories across the country that they don\'t have to worry anymore. . . they can operate as they please no matter how many workers are sick, injured or killed."The fines levied against the two companies were low partly because the Labor Department, led by former management-side attorney Eugene Scalia, has declined to issue mandatory Covid-19 safety rules that companies must follow to protect employees during the pandemic, instead offering optional guidelines.CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOWPresident Donald Trump and Melania Trump have tested positive for Covid-19.

Bush. \xe2\x80\x9cOSHA has to follow the rules . . .penalty amounts are determined by a formula. It\'s not that they can say, \'Oh we\'re going to hit this person for $100,000 because we\'re going to teach them a lesson\'.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cIf somebody dies at work, you would want to think that we\'re going to show in the penalty amounts that this person\'s death was worth something,\xe2\x80\x9d Foulke added. \xe2\x80\x9cBut that doesn\'t always happen.\xe2\x80\x9dDemocrats have questioned whether politics have played a role in the Trump administration\'s worker safety efforts during the pandemic.In a letter to Trump administration health officials last week, four Democrats asked why the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was "watering down" its recommendations on preventing the spread of Covid-19 at the Smithfield plant in South Dakota by adding phrases like \xe2\x80\x9cif feasible" and \xe2\x80\x9cif possible.\xe2\x80\x9dThe lawmakers requested more explanation from the CDC on how and when "outside parties (such as Smithfield executives) are to be included in the process" of drafting safety recommendations.The pitfalls of OSHA\xe2\x80\x99s decision to not issue a Covid-19 standard have been put on display the most in the meatpacking industry, where the virus has rapidly spread among factory workers.At least 63,234 workers have tested positive for Covid-19 and at least 267 have died, according to data compiled by the Food &amp; Environment Reporting Network. The group estimates that at least 865 meatpacking and food processing plants have had confirmed cases of Covid-19.Labor Department spokesperson Megan Sweeney told POLITICO that it \xe2\x80\x9cconducted its investigation and issued its citation in accordance with well-established procedures and legal standards\xe2\x80\x9d at Smithfield and JBS and that the fines were \xe2\x80\x9cthe maximum monetary penalty allowed by Congress.\xe2\x80\x9dBut both the Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama administrations took a different approach when using the special enforcement power under the general duty clause, issuing multiple citations against employers that resulted in thousands of dollars in fines.In 1988, OSHA fined the same Smithfield meatpacking plant in Sioux Falls -- then owned by John Morrell &amp; Co. -- $4.3 million for three willful violations of the general duty clause. The fines were later reduced to $990,000 in a settlement where the company agreed to set up an ergonomics program to help prevent long-term worker injuries.\xe2\x80\x9cIt changed the industry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Debbie Berkowitz, who worked at the AFL-CIO during the Reagan administration and at OSHA during the Obama years. \xe2\x80\x9cUntil then the industry had ignored the high rates of debilitating carpal tunnel which could be mitigated.\xe2\x80\x9dEarlier that year, OSHA also fined meatpacking company IBP Inc. under the general duty clause, proposing an initial penalty of $3.1 million. The company later agreed to pay $525,760 as part of a settlement agreement with the agency.In 2014, the Obama administration cited a Wayne Farms poultry plant for three serious violations of the general duty clause, proposing penalties of $21,000. During that period, OSHA\xe2\x80\x99s maximum penalties for a serious violation were capped at $7,000; they have since been raised to $13,494.Berkowitz, now with the left-leaning National Employment Law Project, says the cases are an example of what OSHA can do without issuing a specific standard on Covid.\xe2\x80\x9cThe administration is totally captive by an incredibly dangerous industry that [is] getting away with doing nothing to protect workers,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.Democrats and former OSHA officials say the worker safety agency could have done more, even with its limited enforcement powers.OSHA could have decided to levy a separate penalty for every area of the plant where workers were exposed to COVID-19, according to both Berkowitz and Michaels.In a recent letter to the Trump administration, Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker also questioned why OSHA chose to issue a single citation to each company and why the citations were classified as \xe2\x80\x9cserious,\xe2\x80\x9d as opposed to \xe2\x80\x9cwillful\xe2\x80\x9d which carries a penalty of $134,937.Weekly ShiftThe latest news in employment, labor and immigration politics and policy.By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

With such a standard -- or mandatory rules that employers must follow to protect their workers from exposure to Covid-19 -- Michaels says \xe2\x80\x9cit would have been much easier and quicker to actually issue citations at these facilities.\xe2\x80\x9dBut Republicans have been opposed, arguing that employers need room to navigate the rapidly changing health information on Covid-19. Critics of a coronavirus-specific safety standard also point to the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s response to the H1N1 outbreak in 2009, saying the agency didn\xe2\x80\x99t issue an emergency standard then.\xe2\x80\x9cWe are still learning about this disease and we just don\xe2\x80\x99t know enough information to meet the level necessary and appropriate to construct an adequate emergency temporary standard and a permanent federal regulation,\xe2\x80\x9d Rep. Bradley Byrne (R-Ala.), said during a committee hearing on workplace safety in May.\xe2\x80\x9cFrom SARS in the 2000s during the Bush administration to MERS, H1N1 influenza and Ebola during the Obama administration, OSHA didn\xe2\x80\x99t issue a new standard but, instead, enforced existing standards and issued guidance,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.But there is a major difference in how the Obama and Trump administrations directed their safety inspectors to police workplaces during health crises.During the H1N1 pandemic, the Obama administration published a lengthy document instructing inspectors to only consider the safety measures taken by an employer as adequate if they were as protective as CDC\xe2\x80\x99s guidelines for the health care industry.By comparison, when employers aren\xe2\x80\x99t following the CDC guidelines during the Covid-19 outbreak, the Trump administration has instructed its inspectors to \xe2\x80\x9cconsider whether employees are exposed to a recognized hazard\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cwhether there are feasible means to abate that hazard\xe2\x80\x9d before issuing a citation.Filed Under:OSHA,CoronavirusPOLITICOFacebookTwitterLink.st1{fill-rule:evenodd;clip-rule:evenodd;fill:#fff}Link CopiedMoreMailRedditWhatsAppAbout UsAdvertisingBreaking News AlertsCareersCredit Card PaymentsDigital EditionFAQFeedbackHeadlinesPhotosPOWERJobsPressPrint SubscriptionsWrite For UsRSSSite MapTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyDo not sell my infoNotice to California Residents \xc2\xa9 2020 POLITICO LLC'
