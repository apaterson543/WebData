A case was reported Thursday at Wasilla Middle School but there is no evidence linking it with a case confirmed Tuesday, according to Matanuska-Susitna Borough School District spokeswoman Jillian Morrissey. The school dismissed students early Thursday and will be closed Friday, a scheduled at-home learning day under the district\xe2\x80\x99s COVID-19 plans. The district will update parents Friday afternoon about the status of in-school learning next week, Morrissey said. About 650 students attend Wasilla Middle School. Another new case was confirmed Wednesday afternoon at Iditarod Elementary School in Wasilla, but the school stayed open after public health workers located all the close contacts of the person who tested positive, Morrissey said. Close contacts are asked to quarantine and monitor for symptoms.
