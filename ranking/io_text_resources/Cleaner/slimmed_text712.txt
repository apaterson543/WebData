Bashforth\xe2\x80\x99s comments regarding this pandemic threatening to overwhelm our NHS, I would suggest his memory fails him.The same dire warnings were broadcast in March as a \xe2\x80\x9cmeasured response\xe2\x80\x9d to the supposed threat but casualties never materialised.Hospitals lay half-empty and new temporary Nightingale types were not required.D. Bashforth is an advocate of \xe2\x80\x9ccontrolling\xe2\x80\x9d our health through misguided unscientific attempts to \xe2\x80\x9ccontrol\xe2\x80\x9d a seasonal flu virus which will entail mass vaccination for all.This folly, with attendant economic ruin and social destruction, seems to be a price worth paying in D. Bashforth\xe2\x80\x99s view for a virus which accounts for a mortality rate of 0.06% in the UK.As to his sociopathic behaviour comment, we see exactly that being enacted worldwide by politicians whose reaction to this wave of fear is not commensurate to the \xe2\x80\x9cthreat\xe2\x80\x9d being presented to us.James Sinclair, Aberdeen.Stoma stigmaRe the article about Samantha Leckie and her stoma surgery: as an IBD sufferer myself who almost had to get my large intestine removed just after my diagnosis, I find this story an important one.All too many people still don\xe2\x80\x99t understand IBD and there is still very much a stigma associated with stomas.D Crighton.So brave of you to share your story, I shed a tear reading it.It\xe2\x80\x99s an inspiration and promotes a better understanding.L Smith.Sadly shutRegarding Aberdeen restaurants closing down. These are sad times for Aberdeen. Places were struggling prior to Covid. The pandemic has made it much worse though.L Meah.\xc2\xa0Help support quality local journalism \xe2\x80\xa6 become a digital subscriber to the Evening ExpressFor as little as \xc2\xa35.99 a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe {background-color: #444444;}.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title {color: #ffffff;}.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content p {color: #ffffff;}.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn {background-color: ##e21533;color: #ffffff;}.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn:hover,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn:focus,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn:active {background-color: #ffffff;color: ##e21533;}TagscoronavirusNHSreaders\' lettersLatest NewsWest Brom sign Karlan Grant from Huddersfield on six-year contractWedding venue owner faces \xc2\xa310,000 fine after allowing 100 guests at receptionBatman stunt double spotted on top of Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s Royal Liver BuildingRescue package from Premier League still on table despite EFL rejectionEngland invited to Pakistan for white-ball series in early 2021Brexit fisheries talks: All you need to know as negotiations enter extra timeKate Davies wins 2020 Polari PrizeCommons to ban the sale of alcohol on site, Speaker announcesBelgian King Philippe finally meets half sisterNetflix shares first look at period drama BridgertonEastEnders\xe2\x80\x99 Chelsea Fox to return to Albert Square with new actress in the roleAdrian Otaegui sets early pace at Scottish ChampionshipTrump takes swipe at disease expert Fauci over mask guidanceIgnore politicians who have flouted virus rules, Khan urges LondonersVictor Moses joins Spartak Moscow on loanLatest Local NewsAberdeen postal workers walk out amid claims staff attended Royal Mail office while Covid-19 positiveAberdeen teenager to take part in BBC Children in Need and The One Show\xe2\x80\x99s Rickshaw ChallengeSafety warning over trespassers at Aberdeen HarbourTwo drivers taken to hospital following crash on major north-east roadPolice officer injured after alleged assault on Aberdeen streetFind your next job withLatest Sport NewsAthletics: Jason Kelly ultra excited as he eyes Speyside testFormartine boss Paul Lawson says continuity has bred confidence as side gear up for Highland League Cup semiLoan goalkeeper Ryan Mullen returns to Celtic from Cove Rangers after injuryGraeme Stewart says he\xe2\x80\x99s facing positive Buckie Thistle selection dilemma for Highland League Cup semi with BroraCup semi-finals are \xe2\x80\x98ideal opportunity to see market\xe2\x80\x99 for live-streaming at Highland League levelLatest NewsBrexit fisheries talks: All you need to know as negotiations enter extra timeBrexit end game sees negotiators clash on fishing proposalsAberdeen postal workers walk out amid claims staff attended Royal Mail office while Covid-19 positiveAberdeen teenager to take part in BBC Children in Need and The One Show\xe2\x80\x99s Rickshaw ChallengeNew face mask rules: Sturgeon says \xe2\x80\x98You may kiss the bride\xe2\x80\x99Readers\xe2\x80\x99 Letters: NHS jeopardy \xe2\x80\x98memory loss\xe2\x80\x99Next PostFollow Evening ExpressMore infoWebsite Terms and Conditions of UseCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesPrivacy PolicyContact usDigital EditionReader PanelShopDatingJobsNewsletterGoogle Consumer Surveys \xe2\x80\x93 all you need to knowReader TravelBook an AdvertBuy PhotosFamily AnnouncementsMedia PackDC Thomson MediaThe Press and JournalThe CourierEvening ExpressEvening TelegraphThe Sunday PostEnergy VoiceSociety#wpc-dct-media-logo .prim { fill: #fff; }#wpc-dct-media-logo .seco { fill: #fff; }DCT Media Logo\xc2\xa9 Aberdeen Journals Ltd 2020.
