The drug, which supplies antibodies to help the immune system clear the coronavirus, is widely viewed as very promising.Trump also received the antiviral remdesivir and the steroid dexamethasone, and it\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s impossible to know whether any of these drugs did him any good.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cHe deserves special treatment by virtue of his office,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said George Annas, who heads Boston University\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s center for law and health ethics. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThe question is whether it\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s good treatment.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9dThese drugs are unproven for mild illness and have not been tested in combination. The steroid seems at odds with medical guidelines based on what doctors have said about the severity of his illness.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThe public is getting mixed messages about his condition and that\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s a problem,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Annas said, adding that there\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s a right to know anything that could affect Trump\'s ability to do his job.HOW HE GOT THE DRUGTrump\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s doctors asked for the Regeneron drug under \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9ccompassionate use\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d rules, which allow a patient with a life-threatening disease to get an experimental medicine if they can\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t enroll in a study testing it and there\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s no good alternative.Trump was given the drug at the White House on Friday before he was taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. Walter Reed is not a site where the drug is being tested, so he may have met that criterion on technical grounds. Had he enrolled in a study, he would have risked being randomly assigned to a comparison group getting usual care rather than getting the drug.Compassionate use requests are decided on a case-by-case basis, and both the drug company and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration must agree. An FDA spokeswoman refused comment on the FDA\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s decision or to say how many others have asked for the drug.HOW SPECIAL WAS THIS?Fewer than 10 of these requests have been granted, said Regeneron spokeswoman Alexandra Bowie. The drug is in limited supply, the priority is using it for the ongoing studies, and emergency access is granted \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9conly in rare and exceptional circumstances,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d she wrote in an email.Regeneron also contacted Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s campaign \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cto make them aware of the compassionate use mechanism, should they need to apply\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d if Biden becomes infected, Bowie wrote. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThere was no promise of access to the medicine,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d she added.Alison Bateman-House, an ethicist at NYU Langone Health, said Regeneron\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s overture to Biden raises concern.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThat crosses lines of appearing to promote a potentially unapproved product\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d in violation of FDA rules, she said. Rather than directing people to enroll in studies, it suggests \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cjust call us up and we\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99ll cut the line for you,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d she said.As for Trump, \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cit\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s not clear to me that this was an emergency situation,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Dr. Steven Joffe, medical ethics chief at the University of Pennsylvania.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cI think there is something wrong with the privileged, the president, getting special treatment that\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s not available to the rest of us,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d he said. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThere\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s so much injustice in our health care system, with so many people not even having access to the basics,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d that the favoritism shown Trump is \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9ca symptom of a much larger problem.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9dTrump spent three nights at a military hospital with a team of doctors watching him around the clock there and at the White House.HOW SICK IS HE?Trump\'s doctor has dodged some questions about details of Trump\'s illness and cited health privacy rules. He has repeatedly portrayed Trump\'s symptoms as mild, and said that oxygen was given to him on two occasions but that he was not short of breath. The steroid Trump was given is only recommended for hospitalized patients who need extra oxygen -- studies suggest it can be harmful in less sick patients.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWe\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99re certainly getting a very confusing picture. There are aspects of the story that don\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t seem to fit together,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Joffe said.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThe White House has an obligation to provide the American people with a clear picture of the health of the commander in chief during a health crisis,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d even if it withholds specific details such as his moment-to-moment vital signs, perhaps at Trump\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s request, he said.Trump\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s medical team \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9chas not met their moral responsibility to the American public\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d to be honest and forthcoming on his health, Bateman-House said. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cYou forgo much of your privacy when you become president.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9dFinally, some are dismayed that Trump received special care while flaunting public health advice about wearing a mask and other steps to curb the spread of the virus.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cHe has an obligation to follow the rules of the United States and he has an obligation to set a good example,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d she said. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWe have problems on both of those counts.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94Marilynn Marchione can be followed on Twitter at http://twitter.com/MMarchioneAP\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x94The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s Department of Science Education.
