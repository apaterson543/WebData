Data from some state labs suggest up to 90% (!!) of people who get a positive result are no longer contagious and don\'t need to isolate."Advertisement - story continues belowLast month, the Centers for Disease Control issued new estimates that showed people under 50 years infected by COVID-19 have nearly a 100% survival rate. It broke down to a 99.997% survival rate for 0-19; 99.98% for ages 20-49; 99.5% for 50-69; and 94.6% for those over 70.Those who died of coronavirus, according to the CDC, had an average of 2.6 comorbidities, meaning more than two chronic diseases along with COVID-19. Overall, the CDC says, just 6% of the people counted as COVID-19 deaths died of COVID-19 alone.The CDC\'s overall count shows a significant downward trend from a peak of 17,054 deaths on April 18.Advertisement - story continues belowCenters for Disease Control COVID-19 death count shows a downward trend from a peak on April 18, 2020 (CDC)A recent study by researchers at the Houston Methodist Research Institute raised concerns about coronavirus mutations as the fall season begins. Among more than 5,000 genetic sequences of COVID-19 they found more than 90% of samples contained a mutation.Significantly, however, the Houston researchers found the mutations did not make the virus deadlier.Florida opens upAdvertisement - story continues belowThe CDC\'s latest survival-rate figures were cited by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis late last month at a roundtable he hosted with health experts from Harvard and Stanford prior to his decision to reopen bars and restaurants in his state to 100% capacity.DeSantis said that along with lifting state restrictions on restaurants and bars, the state is also barring local governments from shutting down businesses or implementing restrictions without any economic or health justifications.At his roundtable, DeSantis asked Stanford professor of medicine Dr. Jayanta Bhattacharya about the studies showing 90% of the COVID-19 testing is too sensitive."We\'re quarantining across the country probably hundreds of thousands or millions of people who aren\'t even contagious, and I think that obviously has a huge cost to society that doesn\'t seem to be getting a lot of discussion now," the governor said.Advertisement - story continues belowBhattacharya agreed that "what is being amplified" in the testing is "something that is not going to pose any risk to you or to others.""It\'s not a false positive in a technical sense," he said, "but in a functional sense it\'s a false positive."I spoke with Dr. Bhattacharya, from Stanford Medical School, about the implications of PCR tests identifying non-infectious, dead virus.
