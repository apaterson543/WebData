The COVID Response Alliance for Social Entrepreneurship is hosted by the Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship, with the support of Yunus Social Business and GHR Foundation and integrates the perspectives of social entrepreneurs through a strategic partnership with Catalyst 2030. It identifies five principles that should lie at the heart of any COVID-19 response effort: Make the voices of social entrepreneurs and their communities heard Prepare to respond, recover and reset \xe2\x80\x93 taking the opportunity to \xe2\x80\x9cshape a new tomorrow\xe2\x80\x9d Collaborate across sectors in recognition of the complexity and scale of the crisis Look beyond healthcare, given that COVID-19 touches all areas of people\xe2\x80\x99s lives Support the shovel-ready solutions that grassroots organizations are already able to provide today The Alliance has released a COVID Social Enterprise Action Agenda, outlining 25 concrete recommendations for key stakeholder groups to support social entrepreneurs during COVID-19. These align around the following streams: 1. Intermediaries and networks to surface the needs of the social entrepreneurs they serve on the ground and provide them with fitting support2. (Impact) investors to adapt their investment priorities and processes, and provide flexible capital and must-have technical assistance 3. Corporations to stand with the social entrepreneurs in their supply chains and ecosystems, and join forces with them to \xe2\x80\x9cshape a new tomorrow\xe2\x80\x9d 4. Funders and philanthropists to expand and expedite their financial support to social entrepreneurs and intermediaries, taking risks reflective of today\xe2\x80\x99s unprecedented times 5. Government institutions at all levels to recognize social entrepreneurs as a driving force in safeguarding jobs and in building a greener and equitable society, and to back them accordingly 3. A warning from the IMF The Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, Kristalina Georgieva, has warned about the damage that will be caused by removing fiscal and monetary support too soon. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are very clear in the message we are communicating to not withdraw support prematurely,\xe2\x80\x9d Georgieva said at an online event marking the 125th anniversary of the London School of Economics. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we do so, then we risk massive bankruptcies and massive unemployment.\xe2\x80\x9d Debt service suspension for poor countries must also be continued, while tax reform will be critical to help countries service their debt obligations, she added.
