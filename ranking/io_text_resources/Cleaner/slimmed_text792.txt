The tough measures will apply in five health board areas covering around 3.3 million people.In the remainder of the country, licensed premises can open for indoors service between 6am and 6pm but will be barred from selling alcoholic drinks.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Ms Sturgeon also requested shops across Scotland return to two-metre distancing and one-way systems.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Deputy First Minister John Swinney leave a lift in the Scottish Parliament at HolyroodCredit:Andrew Milligan/PAThe First Minister announced \xc3\x82\xc2\xa340 million of support for affected businesses but the hospitality sector said she had "effectively signed a death sentence for many businesses" despite the "real problem" being socialising at home.Stephen Montgomery, spokesman for the Scottish Hospitality Group, said: "This latest blow from the Scottish Government will create fear and anger across our industry."We have repeatedly asked for scientific data from the Scottish Government to validate these escalating restrictions and yet we have been singled out, charged and found guilty without any supporting evidence."Read the full story here.4:18PMUK coronavirus cases rise by 14,162A further 14,162 laboratory-confirmed cases of Covid-19 have been announced by the Department for Health, taking the UK\'s overall caseload to 544,275.A further 70 deaths have been confirmed across all settings within 28 days of positive tests.

Understandably,\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0they feel like pubs have become the scapegoat for the pandemic.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0 The \xc3\x82\xc2\xa340 million in support for the hospitality sector is welcome and necessary but the devil will be in the detail. Without proper financial compensation now - and longer-term financial support to help deal with reduced trade as a result of restrictions like the curfew - we risk seeing thousands of pubs, clubs and breweries closing for good before Christmas.3:57PMTraffic light system could see pubs shut in local lockdownsPubs and restaurants could be closed in local lockdown areas under a new\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\'traffic light\' system\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0being finalised by Boris Johnson, write\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Gordon Rayner\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0and\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Harry Yorke.Health Secretary Matt Hancock warned that infection data is \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cnot good news\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d for the hospitality industry.Different options for the three-tiered model of low, medium and high-risk areas have been sent to the Prime Minister and could be announced later this week.Health Secretary Matt Hancock warned that infection data was \'not good news\' for the hospitality industry.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Credit:Jessica Taylor/UK ParliamentThe most extreme measures under consideration would involve the closure of pubs and restaurants, a ban on households mixing, and possibly even the closure of non-essential retailers.Mr Hancock hinted at possible pub closures in a conference call with the Confederation of British Industry when he said pubs were the second-biggest causes of infection, after household transmission.Read more: No final decision from Downing Street on \'traffic light\' system\xc3\x82\xc2\xa03:44PM\'Central Belt\' restrictions could affect up to 60 per cent of Scotland populationThe additional restrictions on the five \'Central Belt\' areas, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, could affect 60 per cent of the Scottish population, according to Sky News."All the hard sacrifices we are making will hasten the brighter days that do lie ahead," Nicola Sturgeon said at the end of the update she gave to MSPs at Holyrood, after detailing restrictions she acknowledged may be seen as going too far.She insisted that without action now, the virus could be "out of control" by the end of October, and indicated she will ask Boris Johnson for more support if needed in addition to the \xc3\x82\xc2\xa340 million announced by Ms Sturgeon today to support affected businesses.3:28PMIncreased NHS capacity to come into effect, confirms SturgeonNicola Sturgeon says that there have been "positive discussions on a Four Nations basis" about a more unified approach towards lockdown.When pressed about New Zealand\'s domestic approach, she notes that its borders are completely closed and that Scotland has "different issues at play" in terms of its integration.On testing, Ms Sturgeon says that with regards to NHS capacity Scotland is in the process of creating a number of regional hubs and is transferring care home testing to the NHS.She says that she wants "routine testing of asymptomatic groups" in Scotland.3:20PMScotland lockdown rules\' impact on hospitality raised by Nicola Sturgeon"The pandemic will pass, so let\'s do all we can to stick with it, stick together, and once again my thanks to everybody across the country we are doing," concludes Nicola Sturgeon.Ruth Davidson, the leader of the Conservative Party in the Scottish Parliament, says that the First Minister\'s announcement is "putting massive restrictions on people\'s lives and livelihoods".She says that small businesses cannot afford to wait for details, and they want to know how much they can apply for and how long the money will take to reach them.Ms Sturgeon acknowledges the "horrendously difficult decisions" at hand, and responds by saying that she will consult with the hospitality sector on its allocation."This is not hospitality\'s fault, nobody is pointing the finger of blame, but it is an exposure and somewhere that they could have got it or they could have transmitted it where positive."Because of some of the characteristics of hospitality - sometimes poor ventilation, places where people especially with alcohol are mixing more and not mixing physical distancing - these are higher risk settings."3:16PM\'We want these measures to be temporary\'"We do want these measures to be temporary,"\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Nicola Sturgeon says, and adds that the Scottish Government will also:Extend the use of face coverings to cover\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0indoor canteens and corridors in workplaces.Ask shops to return to two-metre physical distancing and reintroduce mitigations such as one-way systems.Conduct a further review of Government testing strategy to "build resilience".Finalise a broad framework aimed at controlling the forward going forward.Ms Sturgeon admits that the measures will be "unwelcome" but "are designed to reduce the likelihood of a future lockdown". She insists that shops will continue to trade and that "although [restrictions] are temporary, they are needed".With them, we hope to slow down its spread and that will help us keep schools and businesses open this winter and to save lives. So I\'m asking everybody across the country to please follow these new rules and continue to take the other difficult but basic steps that you know will protect you and each other. Sticking to all of this isn\'t easy, and after seven long months it\'s harder than it\'s ever been, but it is essential.3:12PMScottish lockdown rules: \xc3\x82\xc2\xa340 million to be made available to affected businessesNicola Sturgeon announces that \xc3\x82\xc2\xa340 million will be made available to businesses affected by the new measures over the next two weeks.She says that the Scottish Government will make sure the aid gets "to those who need it most", and will discuss how they can mitigate some or all of the furlough scheme contribution.Ms Sturgeon says that the situation will be kept "under review" and Parliament will be kept updated.3:11PMNicola Sturgeon sets out reasons for hospitality curbs"The R number seems to have risen above 1 approximately three weeks after the hospitality sector opened up," says Ms Sturgeon. "It does show that these settings pose a particular risk of transmitting the virus."And that makes sense about what we know about how the virus is spread. Indoor environments inevitably produce a greater risk of transmission. And of course the presence of alcohol can affect people\'s willingness to physically distance."Ms Sturgeon says restrictions on hospitality for 16 days will significantly restrict the spread of the virus across that timescale.3:09PMScotland lockdown restrictions: \'Central Belt\' to face tougher restrictionsThe Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, Ayrshire and Arran, Lothian and Forth Valley areas - which include Glasgow and Edinburgh - will see the following restrictions:All licensed premises with the exception of hotels for residents will be required to close indoors and outdoors.Takeaways will be permitted.Hotels will remain open for residents.Cafes without an alcohol licence will be able to stay open until 6pm to "support social isolation".Snooker and pool halls, indoor bowling alleys, casinos and bingo halls will close in these areas for two weeks from October 10.Contact sports for people aged 18 and over will be suspended with an exemption for professional sport.Outdoor live events will not be permitted in these five regions for the next two weeks.People in these areas should avoid public transport unless "absolutely necessary" i.e. going to school or work.3:05PMNew Scotland lockdown rules set out by Nicola SturgeonThe First Minister describes the ban on indoor household mixing as "the most important measure" that the Scottish Government could have introduced 12 days ago, and reiterates the importance of Scots adhering to it."To those who will wonder and ask if the measures go too far, let me be very clear," she says. "I am acutely aware that this is and cannot be a one-dimensional decision. We have a duty to balance all of the different harms caused by the pandemic."The following measures are set out over the course of 16 days with the exceptions of five health board areas which will see stricter limits still:Pubs, restaurants, bars and cafes will be able to operate indoors between 6am and 6pm for the service of food and non-alcoholic drinksHotel restaurants will be able to operate after 6pm for residents only and without alcoholPubs, restaurants, bars and cafes can continue to serve alcohol outdoors up to 10pmThere will be an exemption on the alcohol ban for weddings that are already booked and for funerals2:59PMNicola Sturgeon: \'Without action, we are likely to return to peak levels\'Ms Sturgeon describes the measures that are to be announced as "tough but necessary". She says the increase in the numbers of people in hospital with Covid reflects a wider rise in new cases among older age groups.She says that local spikes "should not obscure that cases are rising across the country", with Orkney and Shetland the only exceptions to this."Without action, and this is the starkest warning in today\'s evidence paper, we are likely to return to the peak levels of spring this month," she says.2:56PMNicola Sturgeon: \'We are living much more freely now than in spring\'"These figures illustrate the rising challenge we again face from this virus," Ms Sturgeon says. "This challenge is also set out starkly in an evidence paper published today by Scotland\'s most senior medical advisers."She insists it is "urgent" that action is taken while insisting that the situation is better than the scenario faced by Scots in March.The First Minister says that measures such as meeting outdoors, social distancing and face coverings are all important mitigations."We are living much more freely now than in the spring and in the summer," she says. "We are not going back into lockdown today."2:54PMScotland lockdown update: Nicola Sturgeon acknowledges \'difficult decisions\'Nicola Sturgeon says that she will set out "difficult but important temporary measures" in addition to Scotland\'s longer-term work to "live with Covid"."None of this is easy, I am acutely aware that in every decision we take lives and jobs are at stake," she says. "None of these decisions are taken lightly."She confirms that 1,054 cases have been recorded in the last 24 hours.Ms Sturgeon adds that one further death has been confirmed, taking the number of deaths to 2,533.2:39PMScotland coronavirus cases confirmed in last 24 hours pass 1,000More than 1,000 cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed in the last 24 hours, the Scottish Government has confirmed ahead of more stringent lockdown measures soon to be announced by Nicola Sturgeon.There are currently 319 patients in hospital in Scotland who have tested positive for coronavirus, with 28 of these in intensive care units.2:33PMTraffic light system should not be \'imposed\' without detail, says BurnhamAndy Burnham issues a clear request to the Government for "meaningful negotiations with mayors" and other regional leaders.He decries the current response, and says there is currently only "the odd conversation here and there" that takes place with ministers.He also pushes back against the three-tier \'traffic light\' system\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0touted last month but which has so far yet to surface."We will not have a tier system imposed upon us without the ability to see and hear the detail", Mr Burnham says.2:18PMManchester local lockdown: Cases rising \'exponentially\' as restrictions \'not working\'Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, is holding his weekly press briefing.Mr Burnham says that the rate of infection in Manchester is now climbing "almost exponentially".Although many parts of Greater Manchester have had restrictions in place for much of the last month, he feels "there is not really any evidence these restrictions are working".55 per cent of recent diagnoses have been in the 17-21 age group, he says with less than 2.5 per cent in the over-65 age group."This is something that is hitting particularly a young demographic, very large student numbers and students are affected," Mr Burnham says.He reveals that over 90 per cent of a batch of Manchester University students who tested positive for the virus were asymptomatic.2:10PMUK coronavirus deaths: 54 further hospital deaths confirmed in EnglandA\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0further 54 people\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0who tested positive for coronavirus have died, which takes the total number of confirmed hospital deaths in England to 30,280.Patients were aged between 43 and 93 years old, and all but one of these had underlying health conditions.Death dates range\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0from 28 September to 6 October, although the majority were on or after 2 October.The North West was the worst-affected region with 22 deaths recorded, followed by the North East and Yorkshire, where there were 16.The Midlands registered seven deaths while London and the South East registered four apiece.

And charities have also come under scrutiny after it emerged in 2018\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0that Oxfam staff had paid young women in Haiti for sex while responding to the 2010 earthquake.While many governments and humanitarian organisations have since promised a \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9czero tolerance\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d of abuse, there is little evidence this has had any impact, said Paula Donovan co-director of the Code Blue Campaign to end impunity for sexual exploitation and abuse by UN peacekeepers.Just last week an investigation by the Thomson Reuters Foundation and The New Humanitarian revealed\xc3\x82\xc2\xa051 women had accused mainly foreign aid workers of forcing them into sex\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0during an Ebola outbreak in the DRC between 2018-2020.Abuse and exploitation is endemic within the aid sector and the UK has the power to stop this happening and hold agents to account, Ms Donoavan told the International Development Committee.Jordan Kelly-Linden has the story.12:59PMNHS lockdown policies caused \'avoidable death and harm\', says expertPatient safety advocates have reacted with scorn to comments from the chief NHS operating officer which said the health service remained \'open for business\' at the height of the pandemic.Talking to The Telegraph\'s Henry Bodkin, Peter Walsh,\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0from\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0patient safety charity Action against Medical Accidents, said:It is not the case of this just being about people having been reluctant to make use of the NHS. Many people have been trying to and not been allowed to. There has already been avoidable death and harm as a consequence, yet there appears to be no acknowledgement of that. Whilst I appreciate Ms Pritchard\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s ambition to remain open to all during the pandemic and encouragement of those with doubts to seek help from the NHS, there needs to be more realism. There is a huge backlog to catch up with and evidence suggests that there are likely to be many avoidable deaths and harm \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0as a result of the disruption.

That\'s what we\'re aiming for.Pressed on reports yesterday that initially claimed Rishi Sunak had told musicians to "find new opportunities" - which later saw ITV News issue a retraction\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0-\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Boris Johnson insists the Chancellor made no such comments.The Chancellor has already provided \xc3\x82\xc2\xa31.7bn of support for creative culture industries.We are supporting them through these tough times and get the virus down and get the economy back to normal as fast as we possibly can.12:15PM10pm curfew: Sir Keir Starmer demands to know scientific basisSir Keir Starmer says that the Government\'s response is "getting ridiculous". He says that there are deeply held views on the 10pm curfew, which MPs will vote on next week, and asks the Government to publish any scientific basis that exists for it."The basis on which we set out the curtailment of hospitality was the basis on which he accepted it two weeks ago, and that is to reduce the spread of the virus," says Mr Johnson.People in Soho shelter from the rain amid the 10pm curfew.Credit:Victoria Jones/PA"That\'s why we introduced the rule of six, Mr Speaker, which again he supported only two weeks ago."

What we are doing is a combination of national and local measures that one week he comes to this House and supports and next week mysteriously decides to whisk this support away. He cannot continue to have it both ways. Does he support the rule of six?Sir Keir Starmer says "yes", but highlights tenfold increases in case rates in local lockdown areas. He points to what he believes is a "lack of clarity" in differences as to how local lockdowns are implemented.He adds: "Prime Minister if you actually listened to the question we might get on better".\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0"I wish I could pretend that everything was going to be rosy in the Midlands or indeed in London, where alas we are also seeing infections rise," Mr Johnson says. "We needs a concerted national effort, hands, face, space, and obey the rule of six."12:08PM\'Rule of six\' clash at the despatch box"The Prime Minister ignores the warning signs, hurtles towards a car crash, and looks in the mirror and says \'what\'s all that all about?\'" says Sir Keir. He appropriates Johnson\'s \'Captain Hindsight\' nickname by accusing him of "Government in hindsight"."We\'re continuing to provide support... five billion pounds of support for the North-West, North-East, for the lockdowns of the extra restrictions they\'re experiencing," replies Mr Johnson."Two weeks ago I set out that strategy, making sure we reinforce the rule of six. Two weeks ago he supported it. Last night the Labour Party abstained on the rule of six. He can\'t even be bothered to get his own side to support the measures himself."12:06PMNHS Test and Trace error discussed at PMQsSir Keir Starmer describes it as a "crucial moment if we are to gain control as the virus", but highlights that 48,000 contacts of 16,000 coronavirus patients were not traced. He asks the Prime Minister to accept that this "put lives at risk".Boris Johnson says "this is certainly a problem that we have fixed - the computer glitch has been addressed". He says 800 people were brought in to "chase up" the missing contacts and that the Government is continuing with its package to "suppress the virus"."In Greater Manchester, some of the missing cases date back to September 18," Sir Keir responds. "\xc3\x82\xc2\xa312 billion has been invested in this system and a basic Excel error brings it down."Boris Johnson says Sir Keir "cannot have it both ways" by calling it both a human error and an Excel error. He insists that it does not change the basic distribution of the disease."Although cases across the country are considerably up across the country last week on this week, there are now 497 cases per 100,000 in Liverpool, 522 in Manchester, 422 in Newcastle," he says."And the key point there is that the local regional approach combined with the national approach remains correct."12:00PMNHS Covid response: Health service stayed \'open for business\', claims chief officerA top NHS official has claimed the health service was "open for business for everyone who needed it" during lockdown, despite widespread cancellations and delays, writes Henry Bodkin.In comments\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0likely to cause fury among patients groups, Amanda Pritchard, Chief\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Operating Officer for NHS England, praised the "creativity and imagination" of hospitals amid the pandemic -\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0when one in three inpatients were Covid sufferers.Ms Pritchard also said the NHS was "on track" to have met its targets for non-urgent treatments during August and September.This is despite revelations in The Telegraph this week that patients who have already endured long delays may be forced to the back of the queue by an NHS prioritisation review.Four million patients are currently waiting for procedures such as hip and knee replacement, with the number of people forced to wait more than a year for treatment has risen more than 50-fold since lockdown.11:56AMPrime Minister\'s Questions today: Watch Boris Johnson vs Keir Starmer liveIn the next few minutes Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer will go head-to-head at Prime Minister\'s Questions.There will be updates on this blog throughout, and you can\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0watch live below:\xc3\x82\xc2\xa011:47AMIsrael coronavirus news: Prime Minister\'s wife \'broke lockdown rules\' with hairdresser visitSara Netanyahu, the wife of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, broke lockdown rules according to media reports by having a hairdresser visit her at home, writes\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0James Rothwell.Yedioth Ahronoth, a centre-left newspaper, said the hairdresser went to the Netanyahu residence on the eve of the Jewish holiday of Sukkot.Israel is passing through its third week of another nationwide lockdown following a severe second wave of coronavirus.Israeli officials say \xc3\x82\xc2\xa0the tough rules are beginning to suppress the virus but warn that they will need to stay in place for much longer than the initial phase of three weeks.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Under Israeli lockdown rules, it is forbidden to enter another person\'s home except for essential reasons, such as helping someone in distress.Read more: Second Israel lockdown could last \'much longer\' than a month11:38AMBrussels coronavirus cases spike ahead of cafe and bar closuresCafes and bars in Brussels are set to close for a month from tomorrow amid a sharp rise in recent infections in the city.Restaurants with full table service will remain open for now, but amateur matches will be forced behind closed doors, the Belgian broadcaster RTBF has reported.Worship gatherings will be limited to a maximum of 100 people, it is understood, while there are also reports that the consumption of alcohol could be banned in public spaces.Yves Van Laetham, the country\'s federal spokesperson for coronavirus, said Brussels is currently seeing the second-fastest spread of the disease of any European city, behind only the Spanish central capital of Madrid.11:24AMSecond wave of Covid-19 \'a very serious problem\', says Matt HancockMatt Hancock, the Health Secretary, has said that the UK has a "very serious problem" amid rising Covid-19 cases and hospitalisations.Taking part in a Confederation of British Industry webinar, Mr Hancock said:\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0It is a challenge, and everybody will have seen, from the rising case rates and unfortunately the rising hospitalisation rates which have risen really quite sharply in the last week or so, that we have got a very serious problem on our hands.

Roche are working with the NHS, the Health Secretary is fully aware."I would encourage people to continue going through the testing process - that process is still working."She added: "Roche are

symptoms.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Despite calls from across the political spectrum, she remains the MP for Rutherglen and Hamilton West.The MP developed coronavirus symptoms and took a test on Sept 26.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0She breached rules by travelling to London the following Monday and taking a train back to Scotland on the Tuesday after receiving a positive result.Ms Ferrier is also reported to have attended a church service on the Sunday after she took the test.Ahead of the call, the Labour leader said it "beggars belief" that Ms Ferrier has so far refused to step down as an MP, calling it a "gross error of judgment".7:52AM\'Looming\' mental health crisis fuelled by pandemic, experts warnThe Royal College of Psychiatrists said waiting times for mental health services could "get a lot worse".The college said its poll of 513 British adults with a mental illness found that many patients face lengthy waits between their initial assessment and next appointment - with some patients ending up in A&amp;E.Almost two fifths (38%) reported that they or someone on their behalf had contacted emergency or crisis services while waiting for their second appointment, while 39% said waiting led to a decline in their mental health, the college said.Meanwhile, the figures revealed that one in 10 of those polled (11%) waited longer than six months between their initial assessment and second appointment.Almost a quarter (23%) waited more than three months and 64% waited more than a month.7:14AMChicken factor installs disinfectant boothsA chicken factory where more than 130 workers tested positive for coronavirus has installed disinfectant spraying booths at its entrances.Banham Poultry in Attleborough, Norfolk, was forced to partially close for around two weeks from late August.It has since re-opened with additional safety measures, including five disinfectant machines at entrances to its factories and offices.The walk-in booths are equipped with artificial intelligence and facial recognition technology to identify employees and check their body temperatures.Users walk through the booth and their outer layers are covered in a fine mist of vaporised disinfectant before they enter the building.The site also uses portable hand-held machines that spray a fine mist of disinfectant.6:59AMNew study will map spread of coronavirus in hospitals to break chain of transmissionThe clinical trial, led by scientists at University College London (UCL), will evaluate the use of real-time viral genomic data to reduce the spread of Covid-19 within hospitals.The findings could help the NHS reduce further transmission by determining if an individual caught the virus from someone else within the same hospital, researchers say.Professor Judith Breuer, the trial lead, said: "Spread of Covid-19 infections in hospitals is now recognised to be a major problem for both healthcare workers and patients, and breaking the chain of these transmissions is critical."It is essential that we try out new tools such as viral sequencing to find out why this is happening and to help reduce hospital spread."The study, together with the UCL comprehensive clinical trials unit (CCTU), forms part of the Government\'s \xc3\x82\xc2\xa320 million Covid-19 Genomics UK Consortium (Cog-UK) which allows scientists to map the virus\' spread across the country.6:42AMFifth of parents increased financial support for children during pandemicSome 21% of parents in this age group with children aged over 18 said they have been offering them more financial support than usual since March, a survey has found.The research, from the Saga Equity Release Advice Service, found that some parents have dipped into their savings to do this, or have cut back on spending on themselves.Others have given money that they would otherwise have left as part of their inheritance.Common reasons over-50s parents have increased their financial support include their children having been furloughed, losing their job, or suffering debt problems.Some parents also wanted to help their children buy a home in light of the temporary stamp duty holiday.Alex Edmans, head of equity release said what is right for one family may not be appropriate for everyone, adding: "Decisions should be made based on individual needs and circumstances."More than 1,400 parents aged over 50 with adult children were surveyed.6:27AMHospital criticised for failing to comply with Covid rulesThe William Harvey Hospital, run by East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust, was inspected by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) on August 11.The inspectors ordered "urgent enforcement action" by requiring that the emergency department was risk-assessed for social distancing and coronavirus risks.They found that staff did not always wear personal protective equipment (PPE) correctly in medical wards as well as on the Covid-19 ward, with a member of the nursing team also seen incorrectly wearing a mask on a ward which had seen an outbreak of the disease.They also found that staff did not always use alcohol hand gel on entering and leaving wards and at least seven members of staff were seen entering and leaving a ward caring for patients with suspected Covid-19 without washing their hands properly.The emergency department staff also did not always have access to hand gel or hand washing facilities, with hand sanitiser dispensers remaining empty at both entrances even after the inspectors had raised the issue.And inspectors found there was an inconsistent approach to triaging patients with Covid-19 symptoms in the emergency department.6:07AMVirus-struck universities move onlineThree universities are preparing to move all their teaching online after virus outbreaks among students.Manchester University and Manchester Metropolitan University are moving their teaching entirely online from Wednesday until at least October 30.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThis is the right

Minister Muhyiddin Yassin has tested negative for coronavirus, after a minister who attended a high-level meeting chaired by the premier on Saturday contracted the virus.Mr Muhyiddin, along with 13 ministers and deputy ministers, started home quarantine on Monday after it was discovered that religious affairs minister Zulkifli Mohamad Al-Bakri had Covid."The prime minister is currently in good health. However, he will continue self-quarantine until the end of the 14-day period set by the ministry of health," the prime minister\'s office said in a statement on Wednesday.6:00AMMore than 100 new cases in South KoreaSouth Korea has reported 114 new cases of coronavirus, its first daily jump of more than 100 in a week.Health officials had raised concerns that infections would rise because of increased travel during the Chuseok harvest holiday that ended on Sunday.Ninety-two of the cases reported on Wednesday by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency were from the Seoul metropolitan area, where the virus has been resurgent since mid-August.Health officials have been struggling to track transmissions linked to various places, including an army unit in Pocheon, where 37 troops have tested positive.5:58AMConcerns over possible restrictions in ScotlandThere has been speculation of further restrictions on Scotland\'s hospitality sector, which led to a trade body voicing deep concern on Tuesday evening.Emma McClarkin, of the Scottish Beer &amp; Pub Association, said: "If the Scottish Government is to implement further harsh restrictive measures to our sector, it must include a dedicated package of support alongside it."Without it, the Scottish Government will leave our pubs and thousands of jobs doomed to failure."Professor Hugh Pennington, emeritus professor of bacteriology at the University of Aberdeen, said a targeted approach would work better than bringing in "more draconian rules"."At the moment we do not need to bring in any more rules that will hammer the hospitality sector, or the economy at large. There needs to be a razor-sharp focus on getting the current systems running smoothly and effectively," he wrote in The Sun."We need to hold our nerve, rather than hitting the panic button."5:57AMScotland faces tighter measuresNicola Sturgeon is due to announce new\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0coronavirus\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0restrictions in a statement to the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday afternoon.The First Minister is expected to set out the details of the next steps the Scottish Government will take at around 2.50pm.She has said the new measures will not amount to Scotland going into another lockdown as was the case in March.The announcement will follow a cabinet meeting on Wednesday morning when details of the new restrictions will be decided.The First Minister has described the situation as "the most difficult decision point we have faced so far".However, the closure of schools has been ruled out, as have Scotland-wide travel restrictions.There will be no requirement for people to stay inside their homes most of the time, as was the case in March, though some additional measures in "hotspot" areas might be necessary.5:49AMIndia records more than 72,000 cases in 24 hoursA family visits a shopping district in Bengaluru, IndiaCredit:AP Photo/Aijaz RahiIndia\'s tally of\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0coronavirus\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0infections reached\xc3\x82\xc2\xa06.76 million on Wednesday - rising by 72,049 cases in the past 24 hours.The death toll was up by 986 for a total of 104,555.India\'s death toll from the virus rose past 100,000 on Saturday, making it the third country to reach that bleak milestone after the United States and Brazil.Its epidemic shows no sign of abating.Last week, India eased curbs further, permitting its states to open schools and movie theatres.5:26AM6,000 missing Covid carriers still not tracedAlmost 6,000 people who tested positive for Covid-19 have yet to be traced following the testing fiasco that saw 16,000 cases "lost" in the system.Call handlers are still trying to reach thousands of positive cases \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x93 some of whom received their test results nearly two weeks ago \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x93 to obtain contact details of those they may have exposed to the virus.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0On Tuesday night, Labour urged ministers to "get a grip" on the Test and Trace service, as Health Secretary Matt Hancock admitted health officials still do not know how many contacts they need to track down.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0READ MORE: Nearly 6,000 Covid-positive people yet to be traced in testing fiascoHow the technical error changed the Covid outlook of England4:41AMWhite House infections could have been avoided: FauciTop US\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0infectious diseases expert Dr\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Anthony Fauci, whose advocacy of public health guidelines to fight coronavirus\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0has conflicted with President Donald\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Trump\'s downplaying of the pandemic, said on Tuesday that the recent rash of infections at the White House could have been prevented.Several close aides to Mr Trump\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0and senior Republican politicians have tested positive for coronavirus\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0since the President announced on Friday that he and First Lady Melania\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Trump\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0had contracted the virus."Take a look at what happened this week at the White House," Dr Fauci said in an interview with American University\'s Kennedy Political Union, when asked what advice he had about how people could discuss preventive actions with relatives who believed the pandemic was a hoax."That is a reality, right there. And every day that goes by more people are popping up that are infected. It\'s not a hoax. It\'s an unfortunate situation when you see something like that because that could have been prevented," he said.Dr Fauci has been a long-time advocate of wearing masks to prevent the spread of\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0coronavirus.Anthony Fauci after receiving an influenza vaccine to kick-off the 2020-21 flu seasonCredit:National Foundation for Infectious Diseases\xc3\x82\xc2\xa03:38AMSri Lanka bans public gatheringsMembers of a mobile health services team prepare to carry out Covid tests to control a fresh clusterCredit:CHAMILA KARUNARATHNE/EPA-EFE/ShutterstockAuthorities in Sri Lanka have banned all public gatherings as a new cluster of coronavirus infections expands in the Indian Ocean island nation.Health authorities said on Wednesday that the outbreak centred around a garment factory had risen to 830 confirmed cases while more than 1,000 people had been asked to quarantine at their homes.The health ministry ordered a halt to gatherings such as exhibitions, parties, conferences, indoor or outdoor events, carnivals, musical shows and processions.\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0The cluster emerged on Monday, a day after Sri Lanka reported its first community infection in two months.The country has reported 3,733 cases during the pandemic, with 13 deaths.2:40AMTrump post accused of spreading coronavirus mythsAfter months of minimising the deadly coronavirus infection - and despite being infected himself -\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Donald Trump has continued to play it down and garnered rebukes from\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Facebook\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0and Twitter for spreading misinformation."Many people every year, sometimes over 100,000, and despite the vaccine, die from the flu," Mr Trump\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0wrote on Twitter and\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0Facebook."Are we going to close down our country?
