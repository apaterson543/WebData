Marine Commandant Gen. David Berger, Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Navy Secretary Kenneth Braithwaite were traveling last week and did not attend the Pentagon meetings with Ray. Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Karl Schultz has also been on travel and has not been in contact with Ray, spokesperson Jay Guyer said.The Joint Chiefs of Staff includes the chairman, vice chairman, and the four-star heads of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, National Guard and Space Force.Beyond the Joint Chiefs, other leaders who took part in the meetings and are under self-quarantine include U.S. Cyber Command chief Gen. Paul Nakasone and Gen. Gary Thomas, assistant Marine Corps commandant, a third defense official said.Milley and Vice Chairman Gen. John Hyten get tested \xe2\x80\x9con a regular basis\xe2\x80\x9d for Covid-19, the first defense official said, adding that the length of military leaders\xe2\x80\x99 quarantine period will be \xe2\x80\x9cconditions-based.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAnybody we know on the Joint Staff who was in contact with Adm. Ray has been tested and is observing CDC protocol,\xe2\x80\x9d the official said. All of the Joint Chiefs have the ability to do their jobs from wherever they are working, the official said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no change to the operational readiness or mission capability of the U.S. Armed Forces,\xe2\x80\x9d Hoffman said. \xe2\x80\x9cSenior military leaders are able to remain fully mission capable and perform their duties from an alternative work location.\xe2\x80\x9dYet House Armed Services Chair Adam Smith (D-Wash.) said the "national security implications of the President\xe2\x80\x99s recklessness cannot be overstated.""Our adversaries are always looking for any weakness to exploit," Smith said. "President Trump\xe2\x80\x99s pathetic attempts to exude strength aren\xe2\x80\x99t fooling anyone \xe2\x80\x94 Americans know he is weak and so do those who wish us harm."This week\xe2\x80\x99s developments mark the Joint Chiefs\xe2\x80\x99 second brush with coronavirus.In May, Gen. Joseph Lengyel, then the head of the National Guard, tested positive when visiting the White House, although a subsequent test showed he was negative.That same week, Chief of Naval Operations Adm.
