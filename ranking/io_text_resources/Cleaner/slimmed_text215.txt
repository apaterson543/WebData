Photo: GoLocal Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo is asking retired teachers to consider coming back as substitutes -- and health officials, and retired teachers -- have concerns.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c[Schools] need more teachers, particularly those that can support the distance learning options,\xe2\x80\x9d said Raimondo on Wednesday. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m putting a call out to all [retired] Rhode Island teachers, please consider coming back to be a substitute teacher, and consider\xe2\x80\xa6virtual learning.\xe2\x80\x9dFormer Rhode Island Director of Health Dr. Michael Fine said regarding in-person teaching \xe2\x80\x94 which Raimondo continues to push for \xe2\x80\x94 coronavirus mortality risk increases \xe2\x80\x9cexponentially\xe2\x80\x9d over the age of 50.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cPeople\xe2\x80\x99s risk rises as their age and weight go up. There\xe2\x80\x99s also some association of higher risk with the male gender,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fine.\xe2\x80\x9cPeople have to make their own choices,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s worth thinking through the relative degree of community transmission in each different community before an individual makes that decision.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cPeople under 50 don\xe2\x80\x99t appear to be at any higher risk, but the risk goes up every ten years. And this is a risk of death and not of disease,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fine. \xe2\x80\x9cFor people in their 50s the risk is a couple of deaths for every 10,000 people \xe2\x80\x94 it rises to 10% for people in their 80s.\xe2\x80\x9dWeighing Options - and Past\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re an age group with a bullseye on our chest,\xe2\x80\x9d said Diane Bucci, a retired teacher who spent 30 years in the Portsmouth school system.\xc2\xa0Bucci, who serves as a board member on the Rhode Island Retired Teachers Association, said she thinks some retired teachers might consider the option \xe2\x80\x94 or not.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cI know I\xe2\x80\x99m not the most internet-savvy,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, of online learning. \xe2\x80\x9cI think she\xe2\x80\x99ll get some people though. Teachers are generally kind people.\xe2\x80\x9dBucci, however, took issue with Raimondo\xe2\x80\x99s pension reform as part of the Rhode Island Retirement Security Act of 2011, which drastically cut back teachers\' defined benefits \xe2\x80\x94 and suspended cost-of-living-adjustments (COLAs) for retirees.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe way we\xe2\x80\x99ve been treated by the Governor, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how much interest there is in doing this favor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bucci.\xc2\xa0Bucci said that she knows firsthand how much of an impact the lack of COLAs has had on retirees.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cLife events have been made very difficult for retirees, whether it be living in aging houses, having health issues, or maybe just that opportunity as grandparents to be a little more generous, without having that benefit of a COLA we were promised,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bucci.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cSo now we\xe2\x80\x99re needed \xe2\x80\x94 now we\xe2\x80\x99re worth something, literally and figuratively,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bucci.\xc2\xa0On Wednesday, Raimondo also made an appeal to those who have never taught before, to consider substituting.\xc2\xa0"Even if you\xe2\x80\x99ve never been a teacher, RIDE has developed a free training for Rhode Islanders to start as substitute teachers this fall for in-person or virtual teaching," said Raimondo.\xc2\xa0This story was first published\xc2\xa010/7/20 3:21 PM\xc2\xa0Related ArticlesREPORT: RI Public Pension Reform - Wall Street\xe2\x80\x99s License to StealDickinson Says Siedle Should Be Named Special Prosecutor to Investigate Raimondo &amp; \xe2\x80\x9cPension Reform\xe2\x80\x9dNEW: Raimondo Featured In Institutional Investor on Pension Reform\xc2\xa0Enjoy this post?
