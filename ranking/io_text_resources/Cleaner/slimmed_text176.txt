Sep 28 2020 A new study has found that few Americans have antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, rendered here in an illustration. The virus causes COVID-19.Alissa Eckert and Dan Higgins/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention About 9% of people nationwide have been infected with the coronavirus, according to a new study led by Stanford School of Medicine investigators.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the largest study to date to confirm that we are nowhere near herd immunity,\xe2\x80\x9d said Julie Parsonnet, MD, professor of medicine and of epidemiology and population health, referring to the point at which a\xc2\xa0large part of the population becomes immune to a specific disease. Scientists estimate that 60%-70% of the population must have antibodies to the coronavirus before COVID-19, the disease the virus causes, fades, said Parsonnet, a co-author of the study.The findings were based on antibody levels from a cross section of patients on dialysis in July.\xc2\xa0The study also found\xc2\xa0significantly higher rates of infection among Black and Hispanic people and among people living in densely populated areas.\xe2\x80\x9cWith this survey, we were able to provide a very rich picture of the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in the U.S. that can hopefully help inform strategies to curb the epidemic moving forward by targeting vulnerable populations,\xe2\x80\x9d said Shuchi Anand, MD, lead author of the study, which was published Sept. 25 in\xc2\xa0The Lancet. Glenn Chertow, MD, professor of medicine and chief of the division of nephrology, is the senior author.Density a large contributing factor\xc2\xa0The research was conducted by analyzing blood samples from more than 28,000 patients on dialysis across 46 states. The results indicate that population density may be the largest contributing factor to infection rates, Anand said.Antibodies are produced by the body\xe2\x80\x99s immune system in response to an infection and can be measured in the blood for months and even years after someone is no longer infected.\xe2\x80\x9cAntibody testing is essential for monitoring the pandemic,\xe2\x80\x9d Parsonnet said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe advantage over swab testing is that it gives you more of a historical view.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s still uncertain how long antibodies remain in the blood of individuals after they\xe2\x80\x99ve had COVID-19, but estimates range from at least two months to much longer period of time, she said.Serology testing, which measures antibody levels in the blood, is commonly used to test for the occurrence of widespread illness, Parsonnet said. Stanford researchers chose to conduct this testing on dialysis patients for multiple reasons, among them the ready availability of leftover blood plasma samples from the large population of these patients who get monthly laboratory blood tests.\xe2\x80\x9cNot only is this patient population representative of the U.S. population, but they are one of the\xc2\xa0few groups of people who can be repeatedly tested,\xe2\x80\x9d Anand said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a potential strategy for ongoing SARS-CoV-2\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0antibody testing and surveillance.\xe2\x80\x9dSince end-stage kidney disease is a Medicare-qualifying condition, these patients don\xe2\x80\x99t face many of the financial\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0barriers to care that limit testing among the general population, Anand said.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cUnlike other studies that have aimed to determine the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, these estimates are unaffected by whether people feel well or unwell, worried or not worried, or have access to testing or not,\xe2\x80\x9d Chertow said.\xc2\xa0Testing 28,503 blood samples from patients on dialysis, the researchers found that 2,292 had\xc2\xa0antibodies to COVID-19, a prevalence of 8 percent in the sampling population, and 9.3 percent when standardized to the U.S. adult population.\xe2\x80\x9cThis study also showed a higher prevalence of undiagnosed cases consistent with other studies,\xe2\x80\x9d Anand said.\xc2\xa0Other serologic surveys of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the United States have been restricted to hotspots or underrepresented high-risk, vulnerable populations, and faced challenges to timely repetition and longitudinal follow-up, limiting their utility for surveillance, the study said.\xc2\xa0Wide variation in prevalenceThe Stanford study showed a wide variation in prevalence by neighborhood, ethnicity, income level and population density. Results showed disproportionally high antibody levels\xc2\xa0in Hispanic and Black populations (16.3%) compared with the white population (4.8%).\xc2\xa0And living in densely populated areas translated to a 10-fold higher risk of getting the disease than living in low-density areas.The study also showed a remarkable variation by state, with early pandemic hotspots showing significantly higher rates than their neighboring states. The study determined that 33.6% of the population of New York had antibodies, whereas that figure was 17.5% in Illinois. In Pennsylvania, it was 6.4%, and in California, it was only 3.8%There are limitations to relying on the dialysis population as a representative sampling for the nation, such as a higher proportion of those at increased risk of COVID-19 due to comorbidities. On the other hand, these patients are more often unemployed with less exposure to large groups. With repeated testing, these variations will become clearer, Anand said.\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a practical approach,\xe2\x80\x9d Anand said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt may not be completely precise, but it is internally consistent. This could greatly help health agencies plan for how best to distribute resources and plan for vaccine distribution.\xe2\x80\x9dOther Stanford authors are Maria Montez-Rath, PhD, biostatistician and senior research engineer; biostatistician Jialin Han.\xc2\xa0Paul Beyer, CEO of Ascend Clinical, co-conceived the project with Chertow. Other members of the Ascend clinical leadership also contributed to the work, carrying out the rapid and high-throughput testing of plasma.The study was funded by Ascend Clinical Laboratories. The Stanford researchers were funded by grants from the National Institutes of Health (grants\xc2\xa05K23DK101826 and NIDDK K24 DK085446)\xc2\xa0and by the Stanford Department of Medicine.
