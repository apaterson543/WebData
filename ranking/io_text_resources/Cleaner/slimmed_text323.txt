The fatality rate is the percentage of people diagnosed with the virus, who go on to die from the disease. Experts estimate that coronavirus kills 0.5% to 1% of people infected, but this figure varies greatly with age. Increased testing and better treatments since the start of the pandemic, have seen the fatality fall, but there is still much unknown. Global deaths from COVID-19 have reached 1 million, but experts are still struggling to figure out a crucial metric in the pandemic: the fatality rate - the percentage of people infected with the pathogen who die. Here is a look at issues surrounding better understanding the COVID-19 death rate. Have you read? How the fatality rate of Coronavirus changes with age Coronavirus vs flu: how do they compare? An expert explains: Why it\'s wrong to talk about a second wave of COVID-19\xc2\xa0 How is a death rate calculated? A true mortality rate would compare deaths against the total number of infections, a denominator that remains unknown because the full scope of asymptomatic cases is difficult to measure. Many people who become infected simply do not experience symptoms. Scientists have said the total number of infections is exponentially higher than the current number of confirmed cases, now at 33 million globally. Many experts believe the coronavirus likely kills 0.5% to 1% of people infected, making it a very dangerous virus globally until a vaccine is identified. Researchers have begun to break down that risk by age group, as evidence mounts that younger people and children are far less likely to experience severe disease. \xe2\x80\x9cThe death rate for people below age 20 is probably one in 10,000. Over the age of 85 it is around one in 6,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Christopher Murray, director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington in Seattle. What is a \xe2\x80\x9ccase fatality rate\xe2\x80\x9d? There has been an apparent decline in death rates when measured against the number of new infections confirmed by coronavirus testing. In places like the United States, that \xe2\x80\x9ccase fatality rate\xe2\x80\x9d has fallen dramatically from 6.6% in April to just over 2% in August, according to Reuters statistics. But experts said that the decline has largely been driven by more widespread testing compared with the early days of the pandemic, detecting more people who have mild illness or no symptoms. Improvements in treating the severely ill and protecting some of the highest-risk groups, are also credited with improving survival. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are much more aware of potential complications and how to recognize and treat them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Amesh Adalja of the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security in Baltimore. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you are a patient who gets COVID-19 in 2020, you would much rather get it now than in March.\xe2\x80\x9d What does that mean for individuals, and governments? That highlights the need for continued vigilance, as some countries begin to experience a second wave of infections. For example, researchers in France estimate that country\xe2\x80\x99s case fatality rate fell by 46% by the end of July compared with the end of May, driven by an increase in testing, improved medical care and a greater proportion of infections occurring in younger people, who are less likely to experience severe disease. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, we are seeing a fresh rise in hospitalizations and ICU (intensive care unit) registrations, which means this discrepancy is about to end,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mircea Sofonea, a researcher with Montpellier University in France. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will have to understand why.\xe2\x80\x9d Share License and Republishing World Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.
