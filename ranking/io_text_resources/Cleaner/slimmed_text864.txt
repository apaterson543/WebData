An Associated Press analysis shows that some of the least-populated states, such as Hawaii, with relatively few coronavirus cases received an out-sized proportion of the $150 billion in federal money that was designed to address virus-related expenses. (AP Photo/Audrey McAvoy, File) (AP)HOUSTON \xe2\x80\x93 As coronavirus testing continues in Texas, some have wondered how the number of tests being performed compares to the number of cases reported in the state.According to the Texas Department of State Health Services, there have been more than 7.06 million tests performed in the state since the pandemic began. More than 805,000 cases of coronavirus have been reported in the state. That works out to an overall positivity rate of about 10.23% as of Oct. 13. The first chart below shows that data.The second chart below tracks the seven-day positivity rate reported by DSHS, starting June 1. The standard seven-day rate as of Oct. 13 was 8.24%. However, on Sept. 14, DSHS added additional metrics to the seven-day positivity rate calculation. One is the positivity rate based on the date a specimen was collected. The other is the positivity rate based on the date a lab test reported a case to DSHS. State officials said these metrics will help give a more accurate picture of the pandemic\xe2\x80\x99s status, correcting for a lag in results being reported.DSHS is adding two new positivity rate measures to the dashboard today.
