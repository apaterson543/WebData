Less than 2 weeks after Rose Garden event, Washington, D.C. has biggest single-day spike in cases Oct 06, 2020 11:27am PDT by Walter Einenkel, Daily Kos Staff 55 122 Please log in or sign up to continue. The Trump administration doesn\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t want to give out any information that would potentially help the possible hundreds or thousands of people directly affected by the ill-advised Amy Coney Barrett event\xc2\xa0that was likely a superspreader event for\xc2\xa0COVID-19. This is because A)\xc2\xa0it means admitting that COVID-19 exists in a way that is larger than just the seasonal flu, and B)\xc2\xa0the high level of narcissism involved here has reached truly\xc2\xa0psychopathic levels.That event took place on Sept.\xc2\xa026\xc2\xa0in the Rose Garden of the White House. The one in Washington, D.C. You can tell because there are enormous iron gates and fencing around it, and swamp water leaks out of the doors and windows anytime they open. Well, coincidentally, around the same time that Donald Trump was getting steroid treatments for COVID-19, the district\xc2\xa0was seeing its highest surge of new cases recorded on a single day in weeks. According to Fox 5, between Oct.\xc2\xa04 and Oct.\xc2\xa05, D.C. saw 105 new cases. This is the highest single-day increase seen in the city since the first day of June. The mayor\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99s press secretary released a statement reminding people to practice public health and safety measures like wearing a mask and washing their hands:\xc2\xa0"When monitoring the positive test results, we look for trends over several days. We will continue to monitor this and other metrics in the coming days.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d She didn\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t mention it, but staying away from\xc2\xa0Trump and people in his orbit is probably the safest public health advice anyone would give Washington residents at this time.Up until Oct.\xc2\xa04, the district\xc2\xa0was seeing an average of 40 new cases a day. Washington local news WDVM reports that \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cDC Health has not said if the recent spike in single day cases is from a specific cluster or gathering.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d\xc2\xa0It remains to be seen if and when some source will come through to expose whether or not the Trump administration knew of positive coronavirus tests for Trump or others in the administration\xc2\xa0well before revealing it to the public.Hopefully,\xc2\xa0Trump and his general crapitude and terrible public health practices and policies will not ruin the positive work done by local officials and residents struggling to stay healthy and solvent while political hacks like Mitch McConnell and\xc2\xa0Trump continue playing\xc2\xa0oligarchy.
