I am ready to sign right now. Are you listening Nancy?\' he tweeted on Tuesday night.\xc2\xa0Trump has long called for individual stimulus payments and the continuation of the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses, but has rejected other elements of the Democrats\' proposed stimulus plan. He reiterated that position on Tuesday.\xc2\xa0His barrage of tweets came shortly after the President was discharged from hospital mid-way through his treatment for Covid-19, which has him receiving a course of the steroid dexamethasone. Experts say the drug can cause mental side effects that \'have an impact on your thinking\' and could affect Mr Trump\'s brain.One medic said they see \'substantial\' side effects in around a third of people, including anxiety and aggression, while the class of medicines that the drug belongs to has in the past been found to impair judgement or even to cause psychosis.\xc2\xa0 Trump is seen at the White House on Monday night.

Experts say the drug can cause mental side effects that \'have an impact on your thinking\' and could affect Mr Trump\'s brain.One medic said they see \'substantial\' side effects in around a third of people, including anxiety and aggression, while the class of medicines that the drug belongs to has in the past been found to impair judgement or even to cause psychosis.\xc2\xa0Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi suggested Trump may have warped thinking because of the steroids and said: \'There are people who think that steroids have an impact on your thinking. So, I don\'t know,\' Pelosi said, according to Politico.\xc2\xa0Doctors on Tuesday warned that dexamethasone comes with risks of serious side effects, including mood swings, aggression and confusion.Trump\'s medical team on Sunday said the president was started on dexamethasone, a generic steroid long and widely used to reduce inflammation associated with other diseases. The steroid was begun after Trump experienced low oxygen levels.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Dr Ashish Jha,\xc2\xa0Dean of Brown University\'s School of Public Health,\xc2\xa0 told\xc2\xa0Fox News: \'We definitely see in 30-40 percent of people pretty substantial effects...[of] the anxiety, the agitation.Scientific research has shown that just a few days on dexamethasone can leave patients with memory and cognitive deficits. Corticosteroids - the class of drugs dexamethasone belongs to - may cause psychiatric side effects in anywhere from 1.8 to 57 percent of patients taking them.\xc2\xa0A study published by the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota found that unpredictable \'adverse psychiatric reactions\' were relatively common among people taking the drugs.Experts\' first worry was that the use of dexamethasone to treat Trump suggested he was very sick, since the $6 steroid may be dangerous to people with mild COVID-19.\xc2\xa0But because it\'s been linked to everything from mania to memory problems, and aggression to psychosis, some are also concerned that the president\'s judgement could be impaired as he reportedly continues to work through his illness.Advertisement Biden, Trump\'s Democrat opponent in the presidential election, responded by tweeting a gif that could only be aimed at the president, of himself saying \'get off Twitter.\'Trump also reacted with displeasure to new FDA rules that will make it impossible for a vaccine to gain approval for release prior to the election.\xc2\xa0\'New FDA Rules make it more difficult for them to speed up vaccines for approval before Election Day. Just another political hit job!,\'\xc2\xa0Trump tweeted separately.Earlier in the day,\xc2\xa0the FDA said vaccine makers should follow trial participants for at least two months to rule out any major side effects before seeking emergency approval - a timeline that will rule out any hope of a vaccine before the November 3 election, as Trump had often promised.\xc2\xa0Other targets of the president\'s ire included House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Fox News anchor Chris Wallace.\'Wear your mask in the \xe2\x80\x9cbeauty\xe2\x80\x9d parlor, Nancy!\' he said of Pelosi, in reference to surveillance footage that captured her visiting a San Francisco salon without a face covering, in violation of the city\'s lockdown rules.\'Chris Wallace was a total JOKE. Protected Joe all night long. He\xe2\x80\x99s no Mike!!!\' Trump tweeted of the newsman who moderated last week\'s presidential debates, comparing him unfavorably to his father Mike Wallace.\xc2\xa0Mr Trump\'s tweets come as he is still taking the steroid dexamethasone as part of his treatment for coronavirus. The steroid is known to have side effects that can affect the brain and thought processes.\xc2\xa0Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi suggested Trump may have warped thinking because of the steroids and said: \'There are people who think that steroids have an impact on your thinking. So, I don\'t know,\' Pelosi said, according to Politico.\xc2\xa0Doctors on Tuesday warned that dexamethasone comes with risks of serious side effects, including mood swings, aggression and confusion.Trump\'s medical team on Sunday said the president was started on dexamethasone, a generic steroid long and widely used to reduce inflammation associated with other diseases.

Many others throughout USA. Here we go. This will be the most corrupt Election in American History!\'\xc2\xa0In a lengthy string of tweets, Trump spoke about federal investigations into Russian election interference and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\'s use of a private server for government emails. \'I have fully authorized the total Declassification of any &amp; all documents pertaining to the single greatest political CRIME in American History, the\xc2\xa0Russia Hoax. Likewise, the Hillary Clinton Email Scandal. No redactions!\'\xc2\xa0It came as a response to a tweet from Hoover Institution media fellow Paul Sperry, whom Trump also retweeted more than a dozen times in the span of an hour.Trump has previously vowed to declassify documents related to the FBI\'s 2016 Trump-Russia investigation, and Special Counsel Robert Mueller\'s subsequent probe, which found no proof that the Trump campaign criminally conspired with the Russian government.Indeed, in a follow-up tweet, Trump wrote: \'All Russia Hoax Scandal information was Declassified by me long ago. Unfortunately for our Country, people have acted very slowly, especially since it is perhaps the biggest political crime in the history of our Country. Act!!!\'\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Another stream of tweets lashed out at the FBI\'s Trump-Russia probe and Special Counsel Robert Mueller\'s (above) subsequent investigation \'So I had to constantly fight off all of this Scum, achieve more than any other President in First Term, and then they talk Chaos. They created crimes against me and this administration!\' Trump added in a retweet of Fox News commentator Greg Jarrett, in reference to the FBI\'s Trump-Russia probe.\xc2\xa0\'Can\xe2\x80\x99t believe these con men are not yet being PROSECUTED. Pathetic!\' Trump said of the FBI investigators.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Biden also came in for Trump\'s ire in a tweetstorm from the White House on Tuesday, and he issued a tweet that appeared to be aimed at the President with the caption \'Get off Twitter\' more videos 1 2 3 Watch video China\'s President Xi violently coughs throughout speech in Shenzhen Watch video Nail-biting moment dog escapes from hungry crocodile Watch video \'Guard\' chickens swarm around driver as he delivers package Watch video Rudy Giuliani is caught mocking Chinese people Watch video Woman uses whisker to remove lumps while cooking mince meat Watch video China unveils weaponised drones that can be launched from a truck Watch video Hilarious moment stretching golden retriever falls off couch Watch video Hilarious moment chihuahua is chased by a charging tortoise Watch video President trump dances to \'YMCA\' after massive rally in PA Watch video Pet emu runs around in circles as tries to play with garden hose Watch video Adorable moment determined koala is spotted swimming across a river Watch video Pair of pugs herd cows and goats at ranch in Oregon Trump\'s tweetstorm on Tuesday night followed an earlier tweet that sent stock markets crashing, when he said there would be no deal with Democrats on additional pandemic stimulus until after the election.While some theorized that it might be a negotiation tactic, others pointed to one of the medications Trump is taking to treat coronavirus,\xc2\xa0Dexamethasone, a steroid that can have side affects of aggression, agitation and confusion.On Monday, Trump\'s Twitter account was locked after he shared the email address of a New York Post columnist.Twitter forced Trump to delete the tweet before unlocking the account, citing rules against sharing private information without consent.\xc2\xa0WHAT ARE THE DRUGS TRUMP IS BEING TREATED WITH AND WHAT ARE THEIR SIDE EFFECTS?President Trump has been given at least three potent drugs since announcing he tested positive for COVID-19 on Thursday night: Regeneron\'s cocktail of lab-made antibodies, the antiviral remdesivir, and the steroid dexamethasone.\xc2\xa0Two of those medications are still experimental for treating COVID-19, and have given emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\xc2\xa0And White House physician Dr Sean Conley admitted on Monday that he would not disclose every single medication that the president is currently receiving (citing HIPAA patient privacy laws, which suggests that Trump himself gave Dr Conley permission to disclose some of his medications, but not all of them).\xc2\xa0Remdesivir, dexamethasone and the antibody cocktail are all in ongoing trials - but it\'s unclear if anyone besides the US Commander-in-Chief has ever been treated with all three.\xc2\xa0Those three drugs are \'as much as we know [about the president\'s treatment regimen] - but I found it all really confusing, based on the reports,\' Dr Mark Poznansky, an infectious disease specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital told DailyMail.com.\xc2\xa0When asked if there was any precedent for treating a COVID-19 patient with all three drugs, Dr Poznansky replied, \'no.\'\xc2\xa0\'But the individual decisions are based on the individual patient, and all bets are off when you\'re dealing with the president, the commander-in chief,\' he added.\xc2\xa0\'The implication is that the doctors believe that the risk of using these is outweighed by the potential benefit.\'\xc2\xa0And while we have some clarity on the potential side effects of each of the\xc2\xa0 drugs, how they might interact is a mystery, \'because they just haven\'t been used frequently enough...we don\'t know about the combination,\' Dr Poznansky said.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But even on their own, the side effects of these drugs could be particularly concerning for the president, considering that the steroid can cause mood swings, confusion and aggression.\xc2\xa0The drugs he was treated with and their potential side effects are:\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0REGENERON\'S EXPERIMENTAL ANTIBODY COCKTAIL DRUGWHEN HE GOT IT: Trump received a single 8 gram dose of Regeneron\'s cocktail of lab-made antibodies on Friday.\xc2\xa0WHAT IT DOES:\xc2\xa0REGN-COV2 is a combination of two lab-made versions of antibodies that help block the coronavirus from entering cells.\xc2\xa0One of the antibodies in the \'cocktail\' is based on an antibody that mice produce in response to coronavirus, while the other is based on an antibody isolated from the one of the first US COVID-19 patients.\xc2\xa0The hope is that the treatment drives down viral load, keeping it from overrunning the body and sending the immune system haywire, and preventing the infection from becoming severe.\xc2\xa0WHAT THE DATA SAYS: REGN-COV2 is still in early trial phases, but the first data from its clinical trial found that it dramatically lowered viral load within a week and cut recovery time in half in patients that weren\'t sick enough to be hospitalized.\xc2\xa0Regeneron has not yet studied the drug in severely ill patients.\xc2\xa0THE POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS: The main concern is these types of treatment occasionally trigger \'antibody-dependent enhancement,\' which means the intended therapeutic actually helps the virus invade cells.So far, the trials don\'t suggest that REGN-COV2 is causing this phenomenon.\xc2\xa0Antibody treatments can also cause allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, as well as fever, chills, nausea, diarrhea, weakness, headache and low blood pressure.\xc2\xa0REMDESIVIR, GILEAD\'S ANTIVIRAL DRUG\xc2\xa0WHEN HE GOT IT: President Trump was given his first dose of a five-day treatment course on Friday evening, after he was transferred from the White House to Walter Reed National Medical Center.\xc2\xa0He has since received his second and third dose of the drug.\xc2\xa0WHAT IT DOES: Remdesivir is an antiviral therapy originally designed to treat Ebola.\xc2\xa0Scientists are not entirely sure why, but it helps to prevent coronavirus from making more copies of itself.\xc2\xa0WHAT THE DATA SAYS: Late-stage clinical trials of remdesivir found that patients treated with the drug were more likely to recover within 11 days than those who did not get the drug.\xc2\xa0Their survival odds were about 40 percent better. In May, the drug became the first to get emergency use authorization from the FDA for treating severely ill patients. That approval has since been expanded to any hospitalized patients.THE POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS: It can cause nausea, vomiting, chils, sweating or light-headedness. The drug also may harm liver function, meaning that patients have to be closely monitored.\xc2\xa0There was some suggestion the Trump\'s liver and kidney function were suboptimal last night, but Dr Conley said Monday the president was just \'dehydrated.\'\xc2\xa0DEXAMETHASONE, THE $6 STEROID WITH COMMON PSYCHIATRIC SIDE EFFECTSWHEN HE GOT IT: The president got a dose of dexamethasone on Saturday after he developed a high fever and his blood oxygen levels dropped below 94 percent on two occasions.\xc2\xa0WHAT IT DOES: Dexamethasone is a cheap steroid known to tamp down inflammation. It\'s already approved for use in other conditions in the US.\xc2\xa0WHAT THE DATA SAYS: Although it hasn\'t yet been given emergency approval in the US, dexamethasone is the most promising treatment yet for coronavirus.\xc2\xa0In a major UK study, the steroid cut the risk of death by 36 percent for patients sick enough to need breathing machines and\xc2\xa0by 18 percent for patients needing just supplemental oxygen.\xc2\xa0However, it seemed harmful at earlier stages or milder cases of illness: 18 percent of those on the drug died versus 14 percent of those given usual care.For that reason, many doctors were alarmed to see President Trump treated with the drug because using it suggested either that he was very sick, or that doctors were taking a risk in giving it to him early.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0THE POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS:\xc2\xa0 The steroid is potent, and can cause swelling, headaches, stomach pain, nausea, weakness, dizziness sleep problems, vision changes, skin problems, severe allergic reactions including mood changes.\xc2\xa0These mood changes include aggression, agitation and confusion.\xc2\xa0\'Steroids are always very dangerous medications to use,\' Dr Edward Jones-Lopez, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, told Reuters.\'That is why it (dexamethasone) is used in severe to critical patients... There can be neuropsychiatric side effects. These are medications that we use very, very carefully.\'\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Advertisement\xc2\xa0Top Trump aide Stephen Miller tests positive for COVID: Senior advisor becomes FIFTEENTH member of the President\'s inner circle to be infected after helping debate prep with Hope Hicks, Kellyanne Conway and Chris ChristieStephen Miller, a senior policy adviser to President Donald Trump, has tested positive for coronavirus, an administration official says.Miller, 35, tested positive for the virus on Tuesday after working remotely for the prior five days and testing negative every day through yesterday, according to NBC News reporter Hallie Jackson.Miller is currently in quarantine.
