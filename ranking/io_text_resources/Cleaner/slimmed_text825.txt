HR\xe2\x80\x99s new mandate is to enable employees, guide managers, and leverage AI and analytics to make the most of workforce talent, says Rebecca Wettemann, CEO and principal at Valoir, a technology industry analyst firm focused on the connection between people and workplace technology.Rebecca Wettemann\xe2\x80\x9cHR leaders must be data scientists, IT experts, facilities managers and business leaders,\xe2\x80\x9d Wettemann, one of HRE\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa02020 HR Tech Influencers, noted in a recent live Twitter chat. \xe2\x80\x9cOn a personal level, they need a new level of negotiation, time management and prioritization skills.\xe2\x80\x9dAnd with the coronavirus dramatically changing how work is done, HR leaders have had to scramble in an instant and spend the past seven months strategizing their organizations\xe2\x80\x99 responses to the pandemic.\xc2\xa0But it\xe2\x80\x99s not just gathering new data about these changes that\xe2\x80\x99s so important, Wettemann noted.Advertisement\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s what do they do with it that\xe2\x80\x99s critical,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cInvestments in #peopleanalytics and #AI are key for not just insights, but action.\xe2\x80\x9dFor example, as employers across the country consider reopening their workplaces, they have to be making decisions based on a constantly moving target, she noted.\xe2\x80\x9cWith limited resources, HR needs to leverage tech to manage employee health and safety tracking quickly at scale, while keeping mental wellbeing top of mind,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.And, she noted, 40% of companies have budgeted nothing in these areas, meaning HR has to be creative in how they use existing technology to manage reopening. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is not a time for multiple spreadsheets,\xe2\x80\x9d Wettemann wrote.And what does Wettemann say HR leaders can expect looking ahead?Click here for more information and to register for virtual\xc2\xa0HR Tech 2020.\xe2\x80\x9cNo surprises here: HR\xe2\x80\x99s focus is shifting from recruiting and development to health, safety and labor relations,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWith #WFH, HR needs new techniques to engage the whole employee,\xe2\x80\x9d she added.She pointed to recent Valoir data collected in the spring that showed productivity didn\xe2\x80\x99t take a big hit when workers went remote, but the fall could be a different story, she warned.\xc2\xa0Mental health will also continue to demand HR attention.\xe2\x80\x9cBeyond the initial shift to #WFH, which focused on videoconferencing, HR has to look at long-term impacts:\xc2\xa0 ergonomic, emotional and otherwise,\xe2\x80\x9d Wettemann tweeted.Artificial intelligence and machine learning are both primed to open doors for talent sourcing, placement and coaching, as well as L&amp;D\xe2\x80\x94particularly as more employers look to reskill and upskill employees.AdvertisementAlso see\xc2\xa0HRE\xe2\x80\x98s Top HR Products of 2020\xe2\x80\x9cManaging talent\xe2\x80\x94both internally and externally\xe2\x80\x94is a huge opportunity,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\xc2\xa0But, Wettemann advised, HR leaders, often so focused on their workforces, can\xe2\x80\x99t forget to also care for themselves.\xe2\x80\x9cMake appointments with yourself and your team for dopamine time. With #WFH, we have to recreate coffee breaks, not just conference room meetings.\xe2\x80\x9d Nick Otto is HRE\xe2\x80\x99s senior digital editor.
