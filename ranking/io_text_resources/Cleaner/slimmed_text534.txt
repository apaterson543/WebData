In a news conference Wednesday morning, Amarillo city leaders and health experts spoke about the sharp increase of cases in Amarillo. Casie Stoughton, director of Amarillo Public Health, said the Amarillo Area Hospitalization Rate has now been over 15 percent for two consecutive days. The state mandates that if an area stays at 15 percent or over for seven consecutive days, the business operations will scale back to 50 percent capacity. Dr. Scott Milton, public health authority with TTUHSC, spoke about the different risk factors that increase vulnerability to becoming seriously ill or dying from the virus. Dr. Milton listed those risk factors as the male sex, having Type 2 Diabetes, obesity, having chronic heart and respiratory diseases, the elderly and minorities. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWe are talking about huge number of people who are potentially vulnerable to becoming ill, being hospitalized and potentially dying,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Dr. Milton. Dr. Brian Weis, chief medical officer at Northwest Texas Healthcare System, said \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWe are seeing COVID-19 come back with a vengeance.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Dr. Weis said NWTH is seeing the sharpest rise at NWTH since the beginning of the pandemic. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cWe have a big problem,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d said Dr. Weis in regards to the cases at NWTH. As of today, there are 47 positive COVID-19 cases at NWTH. The hospital is currently activating the internal surge program. Dr. Weis said the ventilator use went up by 10 as of 24 hours ago, with four COVID-19 patients being intubated overnight. There have been six deaths at Northwest since the beginning of October. Dr. Weis says three of those deaths have been from one family. Dr. Weis said the hospital recently saw a death of a patient in their 20\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\xb2s. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cThis virus does not discriminate in regards to age,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d he said. NWTH is seeing an increase in staff members having to quarantine due to community exposure to the virus. As of Friday, the hospital had 12 staff members quarantined. Since then, 23 more staff members have had to quarantine. \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cEven if we have beds, we won\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t have staff to man those beds,\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Dr. Weis said in regards to the staffing shortage. Due to the high number of cases and the high amount of staff members under quarantine, Dr. Weis says \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cCovid is putting a major strain on our resources at Northwest.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d Dr. Michael Lamanteer, chief medical officer at BSA, said BSA hit a new record of COVID-19 patients yesterday at 69. As of today, the hospital has 65 positive patients. 20 of those patients are in the ICU and four are on ventilators. BSA is also working on a surge plan. However, Dr. Lamanteer said \xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9cthe issue is staffing.\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x9d He said BSA is currently looking for outside contract staffing or additional help. Dr. Rodney Gonzales, director of Amarillo VA, said there are currently 53 veterans on home isolation with the virus. That is the largest amount of veterans with the virus the VA has reported so far.
