It will probably be effective from Thursday, a government source said.Several Italian regions including Lazio, around the capital Rome, had already made face masks mandatory.Data from the Health Ministry showed 3,678 cases were reported in the last 24 hours, up from 2,677 on Tuesday and surging past the 3,000 mark for the first time since April 24.Italy is still recording far fewer daily cases than other large European countries such as France, Spain and Britain.Italy was the first country in Europe to be hard-hit by COVID-19 and has the second highest death toll in the continent after Britain, with 36,061 dying since the outbreak flared in February, according to official figures.\xc2\xa0Thanks to one of the strictest lockdowns in the world, the government managed to get the contagion under control by the summer but infections are now rising fast.However, daily COVID-related deaths remain far lower than during the first wave of Italy\xe2\x80\x99s epidemic six months ago.Some 31 people died of the virus on Wednesday, the Health Ministry said, while April 24, the last day with more than 3,000 cases, saw 420 deaths.The cabinet on Wednesday also approved a decree to extend the COVID-19 state of emergency to Jan. 31.The state of emergency, originally due to expire in mid-October, gives greater powers to central government, making it easier for officials to bypass the bureaucracy that smothers much decision-making in Italy.\xc2\xa0Reporting by Angelo Amante; Editing by Gavin Jones and Janet Lawrence / REUTERS italy masks covid19 coronavirus Comments +NEWS +BLOG +CLASSIFIEDS +VIDEOS News Indian Cinema Halls Reopen On Friday: A List Of Bollywood 13 hours\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 ago Qatar books capacity at UK\xe2\x80\x99s Grain LNG from 2025-2050 14 hours\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 ago 10,000 more children a month could die of malnutrition due 14 hours\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 ago North Korea\'s Nuclear, Missile Programs "Serious Threat" To 14 hours\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 ago Sign up For Newsletter Blog Cubits Review: Is it a Respectable Crypto Exchange or not? 1 day ago Forecasts of Cryptocurrency for 2020 1 day ago 5 Helpful Strategies On How To Get More Relevant Online 1 day ago If Welding Machine is Not Working, Checkout This Guide 3 days\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 ago Sign up For Newsletter You\'ve made it this far...
