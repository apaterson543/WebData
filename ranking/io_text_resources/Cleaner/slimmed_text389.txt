Restrictions on movement, increased caretaking duties, and increased incidences of gender-based violence all reduce livelihood opportunities during this time. Lower income can create secondary effects, as women typically invest in education, health care and business reinforcement.Every year, on October 15, the UN\xe2\x80\x99s family of countries celebrate the social, economic, and political progress made by 1.7 billion women and girls who live in rural areas. Member countries also call attention the ways to prevent, mitigate and eliminate the discrimination, marginalization and violence faced by tens of millions of rural and indigenous women.Effective development and violence prevention interventions include supporting women\xe2\x80\x99s livelihoods in smallholder farming, fishing, livestock-keeping and rural entrepreneurship; enabling greater access to land, credit and other productive resources; strengthening women\xe2\x80\x99s representation in producers\xe2\x80\x99 organizations and community decision-making bodies and working with rural men to create positive behavior change.To coincide with the United Nations\xe2\x80\x99 International Day of Rural Women, the International Fund for Agricultural Development and Devex will host a virtual event to elevate the experience of rural women working in the agriculture and food sectors during COVID-19 and to explore effective response methods in this time of crisis.Time: 9:30 AM ET | 3:30 PM CETLocation: Virtual Date: Thursday, October 15, 2020More Information (link opens in a new window)CalendarOctoberSundayMondayTuesdayWednesdayThursdayFridaySaturday\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa012345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031NovemberSundayMondayTuesdayWednesdayThursdayFridaySaturday\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0DecemberSundayMondayTuesdayWednesdayThursdayFridaySaturday\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa012345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0JanuarySundayMondayTuesdayWednesdayThursdayFridaySaturday\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa012345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0FebruarySundayMondayTuesdayWednesdayThursdayFridaySaturday\xc2\xa012345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0MarchSundayMondayTuesdayWednesdayThursdayFridaySaturday\xc2\xa012345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Connect With UsFacebook (link opens in a new window)Twitter (link opens in a new window)YouTube (link opens in a new window)LinkedIn (link opens in a new window)RSSNewsletter Sign-UpFollow UsSocial Enterprise (link opens in a new window)Health Care (link opens in a new window)Financial Health (link opens in a new window)MENUMENUAboutNewsJobsCalendarNewsletter Sign-UpFacebookTwitterYouTubeLinkedInRSSArticlesGuest ArticlesInterviewsAll ArticlesSeriesBig Data: Big Risks, Big OpportunitiesEnterprise in the Time of CoronavirusOpeni2i SeriesThe (R)evolution of WorkView All NextBillion SeriesSectorsAgricultureEducationEnergyEntrepreneurshipEnvironmentFinanceHealth CareImpact AssessmentInvestingTechnologyWASHContactFAQContact UsSubmit A JobNewsletter Sign-UpWrite for NextBillionNextBillion\xe2\x80\x99s 2020 Editorial Calendar\xc2\xa92020 NextBillion, All Rights Reserved.Connect With UsFacebook (link opens in a new window)Twitter (link opens in a new window)YouTube (link opens in a new window)LinkedIn (link opens in a new window)RSSNewsletter Sign-UpSubmit A JobShare A StoryShare An Event\xc2\xa92020 NextBillion, All Rights Reserved.'
