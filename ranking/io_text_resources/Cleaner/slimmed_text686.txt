Eli Lilly and Company announced the partial results Wednesday in a news release; they have not yet been published or reviewed by independent scientists. Its drug is similar to one that President Donald Trump received on Friday from a different company. These medicines supply concentrated versions of specific antibodies to help the immune system clear the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.CoronavirusCoronavirus (COVID-19)Health NewsKDWNTagscoronavirus,coronavirus treatment,COVID-19,eli lillyDownload our appDownload the app to LISTEN LIVE wherever you are and connect with us like never before!Newsletter sign upDon\'t miss on pre-sales, member-only contests and member only events.101.5 FM / 720 AM NewsletterAboutBeasley Best Community of CaringTerms of ServicesAdvertiser\xe2\x80\x99s Terms and ConditionsPrivacy PolicyDMCAEEOGeneral Contest RulesConnectJoin The KDWN Insider\xe2\x80\x99s ClubContact UsListen To KDWN On Our App Or On Your Amazon Alexa/Echo!Community AffairsJob OpeningsFacebookTwitterInstagram'
