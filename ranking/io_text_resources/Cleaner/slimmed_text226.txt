Having lost over 80-pips on Tuesday, the quote managed to bounce off 0.7095 to 0.7152 the previous day. US President Trump\xe2\x80\x99s stimulus efforts and the FOMC minutes could be cited as the main positive catalyst behind the rebound while the coronavirus (COVID-19) woes and fears of fresh trade war probe the optimists. Also, downbeat Australian data offered an additional challenge to the bulls.Trump\xe2\x80\x99s offers fail to convince optimists\xe2\x80\xa6Having earlier called off over $2.0 trillion of stimulus talks, Trump took on twitter to announce spending on pay-check protection ($135bn), airlines ($25bn) and a standalone bill of $1200 stimulus checks for individuals. While the move offered immediate relief to markets, traders remain less hopeful for any actual help, even if the aid package crosses the Senate, before 2021. While citing this, analysts at the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group said, \xe2\x80\x9cDemocrats are unlikely to play ball after saying they favor a comprehensive package over a piecemeal approach. The baseline scenario of no new stimulus ahead of the 3 November election is playing out. The question is: will there be any stimulus implemented before the new president\xe2\x80\x99s inauguration on 20 January?\xe2\x80\x9dOn the other hand, minutes of the latest Fed meeting suggest the policymakers stayed optimistic but expected the stimulus for the economic recovery.Also probing the risk-takers were the fears of the rising COVID-19 numbers in the US and Europe, coupled with the European Union\xe2\x80\x99s steel tariff on China, Australia\xe2\x80\x99s largest customer.Against this backdrop, Wall Street reversed the previous day\xe2\x80\x99s losses whereas the US 10-year Treasury yields also gained 4.3 basis points to 0.783% by the end of Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s North American session.Australia\xe2\x80\x99s AiG Performance of Services Index weakened from 42.5 to 36.2 in September and offered an additional barrier to the AUD/USD buyers.Moving on, Chinese players will be back after a one-week holiday and hence their reaction to the latest market events will be important to follow.
