AND I made inference to a Private Members Fetish Club where you ARE safe \xe2\x80\x94 both physically and personally\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 and you know that you will associate with the type of Fetishists that you want to be with and whom you can trust.In the works are a few easy events that I am scheduling for after the \xe2\x80\x9cHorror-days\xe2\x80\x9d of shopping hell are over.\xc2\xa0 So, look for announcements soon; enjoy whatever you celebrate; and be kind and respectful of what others celebrate, too!Why I Don\xe2\x80\x99t Do ThanksgivingIt\xe2\x80\x99s that time of year and, earlier than ever before\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 even before Halloween\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 We are bombarded by holiday commercials and commercialism.\xc2\xa0 So, time for a laugh and some serious insight into what We put Ourselves through for tradition\xe2\x80\xa6Originally written November 25, 2009First, My many thanks to all of the wonderful people who invited Me to their Thanksgiving feasts!\xc2\xa0 It was so thoughtful and gracious of them and I consider it quite an honor to be asked to share their dinners with them.\xc2\xa0 Really, I am truly aware of how blessed I am to be cared for by so many. (To those who invited Me and read this, I expect you to be laughing at most of it as you do!\xc2\xa0 Be certain to invite Me to other gatherings, though!)So, as I politely declined, I waited a day or two and then told My real reasons for not doing Thanksgiving:1)\xc2\xa0 I am predominantly vegetarian and I have not eaten turkey for more than 20 years.\xc2\xa0 Since any type of meat or poultry in food will make Me ill, I always say that I\xe2\x80\x99m a bummer at Thanksgiving dinners, but the truth is that I\xe2\x80\x99m bummed at the boring salad that awaits Me, or worse, at the cook who thinks a \xe2\x80\x9clittle bit of\xe2\x80\x9d whatever won\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9churt\xe2\x80\x9d Me until I\xe2\x80\x99m vomiting\xe2\x80\xa6 and attempting to make it look like an accident while I aim it at the favorite rug or couch\xe2\x80\xa62)\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t like making people feel uncomfortable in their domains because I am not participating in the gluttony-fest.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Aside from the fact that people always feel sorry for Me that I don\xe2\x80\x99t eat \xe2\x80\x9cmeat\xe2\x80\x9d while I feel sorry for them that they do,\xc2\xa0 I have to endure the, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s how you stay in that shape\xe2\x80\x9d conversations.\xc2\xa0 This inevitably comes from the fattest person at the gathering, speaking with that second piece of pie in hand.3)\xc2\xa0 Since I usually have to eat before I go to Thanksgiving dinner to ensure that I don\xe2\x80\x99t get hungry, what\xe2\x80\x99s the sense in going out if I\xe2\x80\x99ve already cooked and can stay home and watch the football game?\xc2\xa0 And if I watch the game at someone\xe2\x80\x99s home, I\xe2\x80\x99m usually the only woman with all the males and the females get their feathers ruffled more than usual when I\xe2\x80\x99m in a room.\xc2\xa0 Little do they know ~ or maybe they do know ~ that the only thing I would want their men to do is grovel at My feet with tributes.4)\xc2\xa0 There are usually children at these affairs.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the patience or the ability to be polite enough (and I have so much more politeness than seems to be the norm \xe2\x80\x93 especially these days) to tolerate \xe2\x80\x9clittle precious\xe2\x80\x9d and the sugar-high s/he will be on the whole evening until the tryptophan kicks in.\xc2\xa0 And usually, with children, this never happens soon enough.5)\xc2\xa0 Someone inevitably thinks I\xe2\x80\x99m actually going to help ~ or even offer to help ~ in the kitchen or clear the table or something\xe2\x80\xa66)\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 I gave up illegal drugs before leaving My teens and there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a drug in the world that can make Me able to deal with \xe2\x80\x9cfamily drama\xe2\x80\x9d ~ especially someone else\xe2\x80\x99s family drama!7)\xc2\xa0 I am blessed to have been born into a family of a very diverse group of cultures.\xc2\xa0 My tribe considers Thanksgiving a day of mourning.\xc2\xa0 It is the annual reminder that Our ancestors showed kindness to save the lives of starving barbarians who returned the gifts they were given with death to Our people, Our forests, Our buffalo and eagles, with prejudice, lies, destruction, and thievery on every level.8) Added November 24, 2016: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to receive tons of text messages from people I don\xe2\x80\x99t know because someone sent out a group text and folks don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to set their phones to reply only to sender instead of to everyone in that group! \xc2\xa0And there\xe2\x80\x99s always that annoying person who wants to call to find out who you are\xe2\x80\xa6 \xc2\xa0Fix this on iPhone and Android.9)\xc2\xa0 I give thanks every day and don\xe2\x80\x99t need one day to celebrate all the blessings that I have.However, bah-humbug this may sound, I look forward to My day of football and pasta on that third Thursday of November!Yet, softy-that-I-can-be, I always consider the person who has nothing to do for the \xe2\x80\x9choliday\xe2\x80\x9d (but wishes they did) and sometimes, I invite people to come out and have a drink with Me to share some of that \xe2\x80\x9ctogetherness\xe2\x80\x9d that is so highly commercialized to sell you things to buy for Christmas presents.\xc2\xa0 Fortunately, We \xe2\x80\x9cain\xe2\x80\x99t buying it\xe2\x80\x9d and We give thanks for having the time to get together for a little fun in Our hectic schedules!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~UPDATE: November 20, 2016A selfish person attempted to make Me wrong for not celebrating Thanksgiving and insisted that she would call Me on that Thursday to wish Me a Happy Thanksgiving. I told her that the part of Me that is of Native American decent is insulted because saying that to Me is like saying, \xe2\x80\x9cHappy Holocaust Day\xe2\x80\x9d to a Jew.As expected, she insisted that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the same thing; ranted in a way that deemed her version\xc2\xa0of history held more value than anyone else\xe2\x80\x99s truth; insisted that I was being too sensitive (that old trick that good-ol\xe2\x80\x99-racists use when People of Color speak up); behaved as if she had the right to decide for Me how I should feel; and\xc2\xa0chose to be insulted\xc2\xa0(the other\xc2\xa0old trick that good-ol\xe2\x80\x99-racists (even those who don\xe2\x80\x99t know/believe they\xe2\x80\x99re racists) use when People of Color speak up).\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It was her 12-year old son who pointed out to her that no one has the right to tell anyone else what is or isn\xe2\x80\x99t an atrocity to them, and that if she wants her culture to be respected, then We must all respect others\xe2\x80\x99 cultures\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 whether We understand their feelings or not. Out of the mouths of babes\xe2\x80\xa6 Isaiah 11:6, New King James Version (scripture edit 11/20/18)Remember that.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~November 14, 2012I was given an assignment in the 7th grade to find a poem to memorize and recite.\xc2\xa0 My wonderful Mother and I enjoyed reading through many poems in Our library at home and She found this one.\xc2\xa0 What We didn\xe2\x80\x99t know at the time is that the assignment was for a NYCity-wide poetry competition.\xc2\xa0 I came in 2nd place with this entry \xe2\x80\x93 probably because the 1st place winner prefaced her recitation, \xe2\x80\x9cOne Tin Soldier,\xe2\x80\x9d with mention that her brother was a Vietnam veteran, and the vast majority of the judges and entrants felt much less guilt about a poem about the horrors of a more recent war.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 She was a classmate and We celebrated together while wondering why We won with poems about inhumanity and sorrow when other entries were poems about love, achievement, and greatness\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0 Even in the 7th grade, We were aware of how guilt motivates acknowledgement, recognition, and achievement.\xc2\xa0 Evidently, guilt is not a great enough motivator for positive change in how people treat each other.Indianby Rosemary and Stephen Vincent BenetMichael Gray EyesI don\xe2\x80\x99t know who this Indian is,A bow within his hand,But he is hiding by a treeAnd watching white men land,They may be gods \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x93 they may be fiends \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x93They certainly look rum.He wonders who on earth they areAnd why on earth they\xe2\x80\x99ve come.He knows his streams are full of fish,His forests full of deer,And his tribe is the mighty tribeThat all the others fear.\xe2\x80\x94 And, when the French or English land,\xe2\x80\x94 The Spanish or the Dutch,They\xe2\x80\x99ll tell him they\xe2\x80\x99re the mighty tribeAn no one else is much.They\xe2\x80\x99ll kill his deer and net his fishAnd clear away his wood,And frequently remark to himThey do it for his good.They he will scalp and he will shootAnd he will burn and slayAnd break the treaties he has made\xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x93 And, children, so will they.We won\xe2\x80\x99t go into all of thatFor it\xe2\x80\x99s too long a story,And some is brave and some is sadAnd nearly all is gory.But, just remember this aboutOur ancestors so dear:They didn\xe2\x80\x99t find any empty land,The Indians were here.Benet, Rosemary and Stephen Vincent.A Book of Americans.
