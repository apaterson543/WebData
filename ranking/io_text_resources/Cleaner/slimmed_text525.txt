First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in the Scottish Parliament at Holyrood.Around 3.4 million people living in central Scotland will be subject to even tougher restrictions, with all pubs and restaurants ordered to close entirely until further notice.There will, however, be exemptions to the rules \xe2\x80\x93 in all parts of the country \xe2\x80\x93 for services linked to specific life events, such as wedding that are already booked and funerals.In a statement to the Scottish Parliament, as daily coronavirus cases in Scotland surged past 1,000 for the first time, the first minister said the \xe2\x80\x9cvast majority\xe2\x80\x9d of pubs and restaurants had worked hard to ensure the safety of their staff and customers.But she added: \xe2\x80\x9cIndoor environments, where different households from different age groups can mix, inevitably present a risk of transmission.\xe2\x80\x9cThat risk can be increased in some hospitality premises if good ventilation is difficult, and if it is hard to control the movement of people. The presence of alcohol can, of course, affect people\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to physically distance.\xe2\x80\x9dMs Sturgeon announced new regulations to extend the mandatory use of face coverings in indoor communal settings, including staff canteens and corridors in workplaces.And shops and supermarkets will be asked from this weekend to return to two-metre physical distancing and reintroduce one-way systems.The announcement was met with despair from Scotland\xe2\x80\x99s licensed trade, with Stephen Montgomery, spokesman for the Scottish Hospitality Group, warning it could be catastrophic for the sector.He said: \xe2\x80\x9cThe first minister has effectively signed a death sentence for many businesses across the Scottish hospitality industry, while the real problem is socialising at home.\xe2\x80\x9cWe have repeatedly implemented the safety measures required by the government, and more, to protect our customers and staff.\xe2\x80\x9cWe are part of the solution to combat this virus, not part of the problem. This latest blow from the Scottish Government will create fear and anger across our industry.\xe2\x80\x9d Richard Leonard.Mr Montgomery said the measures would put a \xe2\x80\x9ccrippling stranglehold\xe2\x80\x9d on many pubs and restaurants and warned they may not survive the winter. He renewed calls for scientific evidence behind the measures to be published.This call was echoed in the chamber by Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard, who said the sector \xe2\x80\x9cis not Sodom and Gomorrah and should not be treated as such\xe2\x80\x9d.\xe2\x80\x9cWhy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t the first minister consider closing down those businesses which are not complying with guidance, instead of shutting down every single business, serving 70% of the population, including those which are fully complying?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Leonard asked.\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the evidence that Covid is spreading in all hospitality settings to warrant a blanket ban on all of these establishments?\xe2\x80\x9dMeanwhile, Joe Crawford, director for Scotland at the Campaign for Real Ale, said the announcement was \xe2\x80\x9cabsolutely devastating news for pubs and breweries\xe2\x80\x9d and warned thousands of premises could close for good by Christmas.Ms Sturgeon acknowledged the new measures would be disruptive and unwelcome to many but pledged support for the firms hardest hit.\xe2\x80\x9cI know that the measures we are proposing today will have a significant impact on many businesses,\xe2\x80\x9d the SNP leader said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd since the Government is placing an obligation on businesses, we also have an obligation to help businesses.\xe2\x80\x9cI can announce that we are making available an additional \xc2\xa340 million to support businesses that will be affected by these measures over the next two weeks.\xe2\x80\x9cWe will work with the affected sectors \xe2\x80\x93 especially hospitality \xe2\x80\x93 in the coming days to ensure that this money provides the most help to those who most need it.\xe2\x80\x9dHowever, the Scottish Beer and Pub Association said the \xc2\xa340 million is unlikely to have a large impact and warned thousands of jobs are now at high risk, not just in the pub and hospitality sector but across the wider supply chain.\xc2\xa0CEO Emma McClarkin said the restrictions would \xe2\x80\x9cdeliver a knockout blow for many of Scotland\xe2\x80\x99s much-loved pubs and the communities they serve\xe2\x80\x9d.\xe2\x80\x9cThe financial support on offer is of course welcome, but it does not go nearly far enough,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cFor the majority of premises, the available funds will not even come close to covering the required furlough contributions for the period, never mind ongoing costs and stock. \xe2\x80\x9cWe need to review the financial support on offer and work with government to protect as many pubs, jobs and livelihoods as possible.\xe2\x80\x9dRuth Davidson, the Scottish Conservatives\xe2\x80\x99 leader at Holyrood, said owners \xe2\x80\x9cdeserve better\xe2\x80\x9d and should have been consulted in advance of the announcement. Ruth Davidson.\xe2\x80\x9cA one-day consultation after today\xe2\x80\x99s announcement \xe2\x80\x93 and just hours before businesses are forced to close their doors \xe2\x80\x93 is just not good enough,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThese businesses deserve better.\xe2\x80\x9cThey need to know how much they can apply for, when they can apply for it and how long they will have to wait before support reaches them. Those answers could have been provided but Nicola Sturgeon failed to do that.\xe2\x80\x9dIt came as official figures released by the Scottish Government on Wednesday indicated 1,054 new cases had been registered overnight \xe2\x80\x93 13% of people newly tested.One death had been recorded in the previous 24 hours, taking the total under this measure \xe2\x80\x93 patients who died within 28 days of first testing positive \xe2\x80\x93 to 2,533.There were 319 people in hospital confirmed to have the virus, up by 57 in 24 hours. Of those patients, 28 were in intensive care \xe2\x80\x93 an increase of three.In full: The measures being rolled out across ScotlandNationwide (excepting central belt areas):All hospitality premises may only open indoors between 6am and 6pm, with no sales of alcohol.Premises may open outdoors until 10pm, with sales of alcohol (where licensed).Takeaways (including from pubs and restaurants) can continue.Evening meals may be served in accommodation for residents only but no alcohol can be served.Current meeting rules, maximum of six people from two households, continue to apply.Specific life events, such as weddings and funerals, may continue with alcohol being served, with current meeting rules for these events (20-person limit in regulated premises only).Central belt area focusing on five health boards (Ayrshire and Arran; Forth Valley; Greater Glasgow and Clyde; Lanarkshire; Lothian):All licensed premises will be required to close, with the exception of takeaway services.Caf\xc3\xa9s (unlicensed premises) which don\xe2\x80\x99t have an alcohol licence will be able to open between 6am and 6pm.Evening meals may be served in accommodation for residents only but no alcohol can be served.Specific life events, such as weddings and funerals, may continue with alcohol being served, with current meeting rules for these events (20-person limit in regulated premises only).No group exercise classes for indoor gyms and sports courts, pools with an exemption for under-18s.No adult (18+) contact sports or training, except professional sports, indoor or outdoor.No outdoor live events.Snooker/pool halls, indoor bowling, casinos and bingo halls are to close.Public transport use should be minimised as much as possible, such as for education and work, where it cannot be done from home.Current meeting rules, maximum of six people from two households, continue to apply.Help support quality local journalism \xe2\x80\xa6 become a digital subscriber to the Evening ExpressFor as little as \xc2\xa35.99 a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe {background-color: #444444;}.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title {color: #ffffff;}.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content p {color: #ffffff;}.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn {background-color: ##e21533;color: #ffffff;}.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn:hover,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn:focus,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn:active {background-color: #ffffff;color: ##e21533;}TagscoronavirusCovid-19hospitalityNicola SturgeonRichard LeonardRuth DavidsonMore from the Evening Express Specials teamSpecialsBrexit fisheries talks: All you need to know as negotiations enter extra time15/10/2020SpecialsNew face mask rules: Sturgeon says \xe2\x80\x98You may kiss the bride\xe2\x80\x9915/10/2020SpecialsCeltic v Rangers: First Minister makes her pitch to Sky Sports15/10/2020More from the Evening ExpressBrexit fisheries talks: All you need to know as negotiations enter extra timeBrexit end game sees negotiators clash on fishing proposalsNew face mask rules: Sturgeon says \xe2\x80\x98You may kiss the bride\xe2\x80\x99Celtic v Rangers: First Minister makes her pitch to Sky SportsTwo drivers taken to hospital following crash on major north-east roadBest 2020 Christmas presents for kids, according to Hamleys expertsSober October: Hospitality bosses call indoor booze ban \xe2\x80\x98crippling stranglehold\xe2\x80\x99Next PostFollow Evening ExpressMore infoWebsite Terms and Conditions of UseCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesPrivacy PolicyContact usDigital EditionReader PanelShopDatingJobsNewsletterGoogle Consumer Surveys \xe2\x80\x93 all you need to knowReader TravelBook an AdvertBuy PhotosFamily AnnouncementsMedia PackDC Thomson MediaThe Press and JournalThe CourierEvening ExpressEvening TelegraphThe Sunday PostEnergy VoiceSociety#wpc-dct-media-logo .prim { fill: #fff; }#wpc-dct-media-logo .seco { fill: #fff; }DCT Media Logo\xc2\xa9 Aberdeen Journals Ltd 2020.
