Anti-lockdown PetitionHomeLatest NewsNewsCultureEconomyPoliticsGovernmentGlobalismScience &amp; TechVideos CoronavirusOver 6000 Scientists, Doctors Sign Anti-lockdown PetitionCalls for only \xe2\x80\x98focused protection\xe2\x80\x99 of vulnerable people from COVID so everyone else can build herd immunity Published 1 week ago on 7 October, 2020Steve Watson ScreenshotShareTweetOver six thousand scientists and doctors have signed a petition against coronavirus lockdown measures, urging that those not in the at risk category should be able to get on with their lives as normal, and that lockdown rules in both the US and UK are causing \xe2\x80\x98irreparable damage\xe2\x80\x99.Those who have signed include professors from the world\xe2\x80\x99s leading universities. Oxford University professor Dr Sunetra Gupta was one of the authors of the open letter that was sent with the petition, along with Harvard University\xe2\x80\x99s Dr Martin Kulldorff and Stanford\xe2\x80\x99s Dr Jay Bhattacharya.It declares that social distancing and mask mandates are causing \xe2\x80\x98damaging physical and mental health impacts.\xe2\x80\x99The petition, dubbed the Great Barrington Declaration after the town in Massachusetts where it was written, has been signed by close to 54,000 members of the public at time of writing, as well as over 2600 medical and public health scientists and around 3500 medical practitioners.\xe2\x80\x9cThose who are not vulnerable should immediately be allowed to resume life as normal,\xe2\x80\x9d it notes, adding \xe2\x80\x9cKeeping these [lockdown] measures in place until a vaccine is available will cause irreparable damage, with the underprivileged disproportionately harmed.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cCurrent lockdown policies are producing devastating effects on short and long-term public health,\xe2\x80\x9d the declaration also declares.It continues, \xe2\x80\x9cThe results (to name a few) include lower childhood vaccination rates, worsening cardiovascular [heart] disease outcomes, fewer cancer screenings and deteriorating mental health \xe2\x80\x93 leading to greater excess mortality in years to come, with the working class and younger members of society carrying the heaviest burden.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cKeeping students out of school is a grave injustice,\xe2\x80\x9d the declaration adds.\xe2\x80\x9cThose who are not vulnerable should immediately be allowed to resume life as normal, it concludes, explaining that \xe2\x80\x9cSimple hygiene measures, such as hand washing and staying home when sick should be practiced by everyone to reduce the herd immunity threshold.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cSchools and universities should be open for in-person teaching. Extracurricular activities, such as sports, should be resumed. Young low-risk adults should work normally, rather than from home,\xe2\x80\x9d it emphasises.Finally, the declaration demands that normal life should resume, stating that \xe2\x80\x9cRestaurants and other businesses should open. Arts, music, sport and other cultural activities should resume. People who are more at risk may participate if they wish, while society as a whole enjoys the protection conferred upon the vulnerable by those who have built up herd immunity.\xe2\x80\x9dThe declaration echoes President Trump\xe2\x80\x99s words earlier this week when he returned to the White House and asked Americans not to live in fear or let let the virus dominate their everyday lives:pic.twitter.com/OxmRcZ5nUZ\xe2\x80\x94 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 5, 2020The declaration dovetails with other research that has concluded lockdowns will conservatively\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cdestroy at least seven times more years of human life\xe2\x80\x9d than they save.Germany\xe2\x80\x99s Minister of Economic Cooperation and Development, Gerd Muller, has warned that lockdown measures throughout the globe will end up killing more people than the Coronavirus itself.In an interview with German newspaper Handelsblatt, Muller warned that the response to the global pandemic has resulted in\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cone of the biggest\xe2\x80\x9d hunger and poverty crises in history.Muller\xe2\x80\x99s comments come five months after\xc2\xa0a leaked study from inside the German Ministry of the Interior revealed that the impact of the country\xe2\x80\x99s lockdown could end up killing more people than the coronavirus due to victims of other serious illnesses not receiving treatment.As we have previously highlighted, in the UK there have already been up to 10,000 excess deaths as a result of seriously ill people avoiding hospitals due to COVID-19 or not having their hospital treatments cancelled.Professor Richard Sullivan also warned that there will be more excess cancer deaths in the UK than total coronavirus deaths due to people\xe2\x80\x99s access to screenings and treatment being restricted as a result of the lockdown.His comments were echoed by Peter Nilsson, a Swedish professor of internal medicine and epidemiology at Lund University, who said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so important to understand that the deaths of COVID-19 will be far less than the deaths caused by societal lockdown when the economy is ruined.\xe2\x80\x9dAccording to Professor Karol Sikora, an NHS consultant oncologist, there could be 50,000 excess deaths from cancer as a result of routine screenings being suspended during the lockdown in the UK.In addition,\xc2\xa0a study published in The Lancet\xc2\xa0that notes\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cphysical distancing, school closures, trade restrictions, and country lockdowns\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0are worsening global child malnutrition.Experts have also warned that there will be 1.4 million deaths globally from untreated TB infections due to the lockdown.As we further previously highlighted, a data analyst consortium in South Africa found that the economic consequences of the country\xe2\x80\x99s lockdown will lead to 29 times more people dying than the coronavirus itself.Hundreds of doctors are also on record as opposing lockdown measures,\xc2\xa0warning that they will cause more death than the coronavirus itself.Despite citizens across the world being told to observe the lockdown to \xe2\x80\x9csave lives,\xe2\x80\x9d numerous experts who are now warning that the lockdown could end up costing more lives are being ignored or smeared by the media.

Published 4 hours ago on 14 October, 2020Paul Joseph Watson Nicholas WhitcombeA video out of the UK shows a gym owner explaining how armed police were sent to issue fines because his business violated COVID restrictions by failing to close down following a government mandate.Nicholas Whitcombe previously announced via a YouTube video that his Bodytec Fitness gym, which is located in Wirral, would be remaining open despite a new law that mandates all gyms in the region close their doors due to a rise in coronavirus infections.\xe2\x80\x9cThe UK\xe2\x80\x99s Government has took it upon themselves to close gyms in the North West, despite the overwhelming evidence that gyms are not a major spreaders of COVID,\xe2\x80\x9d says a description on his fundraiser page.\xe2\x80\x9cWe respected the last lockdown although we financially suffered and only survived because of our amazing members. However they now want us to close, with minimum financial support for 6 months. We get no rent break, bills break both personally and as a business,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, asserting that he would keep his gum open for his members\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cmental and physical well-being.\xe2\x80\x9dThis prompted a visit by several armed police officers seen in a video originally posted by Whitcome to Instagram.This just seems so unjust. We are told that obesity can increase your risk from covid. So why on earth are we insisting that gyms must close? I really feel for businesses owners like this in Liverpool.

We may need masks until July,\xe2\x80\x9d Pollard said during an online seminar with Oxford alumni.\xe2\x80\x9cIf we end up with a vaccine that\xe2\x80\x99s effective in preventing the disease, that is by far the best way to control the virus. But in the medium term, we\xe2\x80\x99ll still need better treatments,\xe2\x80\x9d the professor added.\xe2\x80\x9cWhen does life get back to normal? Even if we had enough vaccine for everyone, in my view it\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to very rapidly be in a position where the physical distancing rules can be just dropped,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.Politicians and health advisors to governments have repeatedly said that strict measures will have to remain in place until a vaccine is available.\xe2\x80\x9cUntil we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a high level of immunity in the population so that we can stop the virus so most vulnerable people are immune, there is going to be a risk. Initially, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be in a position where mask-wearing and social distancing don\xe2\x80\x99t change,\xe2\x80\x9d Pollard reiterated.\xe2\x80\x9cOnly when there is a big drop in serious cases will governments feel able to relax these measures. This is a very easily transmissible virus,\xe2\x80\x9d he further commented.Back in May, scientists\xc2\xa0expressed doubts over the effectiveness of Oxford\xe2\x80\x99s coronavirus vaccine, after all of the monkeys used in initial testing later contracted coronavirus.While funding is pouring into vaccine trials, other research on coronavirus treatments has all but been ignored, despite some scientists claiming to have discovered anti-bodies that can completely block COVID-19\xc2\xa0or effectively neutralise the virus.
