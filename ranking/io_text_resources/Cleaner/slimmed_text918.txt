The screeningwhich pinpointed the lead compound was performed at the Universityof Georgia, College of Pharmacy under the leadership of Dr. ScottD. Pegan, Director of the Center for Drug Discovery and InterimAssociate Head of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Sciences. TheCompany is currently looking into expanding its collaboration withthe University of Georgia and will be seeking the University\xe2\x80\x99sassistance in advancing the development of the newly identifiedlead compound.The compounds which werescreened are based on the technology described in SunshineBiopharma\xe2\x80\x99s recently filed patent application covering smallmolecules which can be used to treat Coronavirus infections. Next,Sunshine\xe2\x80\x99s lead compound will be put through a battery of invitro tests to evaluate its specific inhibitory activityagainst the SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PLpro), one of twovirus encoded proteases essential for viral replication. Inaddition to cleaving the virus encoded polyprotein at threedifferent sites to generate mature virus proteins, PLpro alsocleaves certain host proteins resulting in suppression of the hostimmune response and allowing virus replication to proceed uncheckedwhich enhances the virus\xe2\x80\x99 ability to cause severe morbidity.Following the in vitro tests, the lead compound will bemoved forward to the cell culture testing stage followed by micestudies before entering human clinicaltrials.About SunshineBiopharma\xe2\x80\x99s Coronavirus TreatmentSevere Acute RespiratorySyndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent ofCOVID-19, the current ongoing pandemic that has claimed the livesof over 1,000,000 people worldwide since it first appeared inDecember 2019. There are currently no drugs that can effectivelyarrest replication of the virus in people who have contracted theillness. On May 22, 2020, Sunshine Biopharma filed a provisionalpatent application for a library of molecules which were designedto inhibit the Coronavirus proteases, thus shutting down theability of the virus to multiply and causeillness.About the Universityof GeorgiaAs part of its land granttripartite mission, the University of Georgia is committed tocreating and applying new knowledge for the public good.\xc2\xa0UGA\xe2\x80\x99s Center for Drug Discovery as well as the Colleges of Pharmacyare excited to be a part of this ground-breaking research relatedto discovery of new treatment options for COVID-19. Profs. ScottPegan, and David Crich will be working with Sunshine Biopharma tospearhead the study of novel therapeutics for the prevention andspread of COVID-19. This interdisciplinary effort involves state ofthe art approaches in chemical synthesis and drug screening. Thiscontinues University of Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s long-standing tradition intranslating scientific breakthroughs to address real world healthconcerns.About SunshineBiopharmaIn addition, to working onthe development of a treatment for COVID-19, Sunshine Biopharma isengaged in the development Adva-27a, a unique anticancer compound.Tests conducted to date have demonstrated the effectiveness ofAdva-27a at destroying Multidrug Resistant Cancer Cells, includingPancreatic Cancer cells, Small-Cell Lung Cancer cells, BreastCancer cells, and Uterine Sarcoma cells.
