After landing in Marine One, Trump walked up the stairs of the South Portico, removed his mask and looked over the balcony.The president was near an official photographer and other staffers could be seen behind him. He did not put his mask back as he turned to walk back into the White House.The image reflects how Trump appears largely unchanged in his views toward COVID-19 even after contracting the virus that has killed more than 200,000 Americans and infected millions in the U.S. The president earlier in the day tweeted to his followers \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid of Covid. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let it dominate your life.\xe2\x80\x9dTrump \xe2\x80\x94 infected with COVID-19 \xe2\x80\x94 takes off his mask and enters the White House with others clearly standing nearby pic.twitter.com/fNpiP6SA5S\xe2\x80\x94 Will Steakin (@wsteaks) October 5, 2020 Trump first revealed last Friday that he and the first lady had tested positive for the virus. He was taken to Walter Reed later that day and has been showing symptoms, including fatigue and fever. The president required supplemental oxygen on Friday and Saturday as well.White House physician Sean Conley told reporters earlier Monday that Trump was healthy enough to leave the hospital, citing his vitals and clinical evaluations. But he acknowledged that the president, who is 74 and overweight and thus at risk for severe complications, was not out of the woods yet.\xe2\x80\x9cIf we can get through to Monday with him remaining the same or improving better yet, then we will all take that final deep sigh of relief,\xe2\x80\x9d Conley said. But this video, of Trump appearing to gasp for air, is rather frightening:Trump looks like he is gasping for air pic.twitter.com/4k2v4Jxlir\xe2\x80\x94 Brennan Murphy (@brenonade) October 5, 2020People on Twitter are very concerned:honestly what in the hell is going on https://t.co/mFUmTNEJce\xe2\x80\x94 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) October 5, 2020maybe he has covid from failing to follow cdc guidelines https://t.co/IsK3GvYbGO\xe2\x80\x94 George Conway (@gtconway3d) October 5, 2020Showed this to doctor. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s having trouble breathing.
