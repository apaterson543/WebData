FILE 1\xc2\xa0comment HAVING jumped through a variety of health and safety hoops to make it happen, organisers of the 64th Isle of Wight Marathon were delighted it went ahead as planned, with a new course record to show for it, despite the appalling weather. With all the Covid-19 restrictions in place it was a very different race this year with the start having to be socially distanced. Gary Marshall, right, hot on the heels of Mike Boucher. After putting in much spadework to prove they could meet the Covid-19 guidelines set out by UK Athletics and Run Britain, Ryde Harriers saw 177 runners \xe2\x80\x94 the best field for many years \xe2\x80\x94 set off from the Isle of Wight Community Club, Cowes, on Sunday.

Gary Marshall, of Ryde Harriers, came fourth. In a normal year, the field would cross the start line in about 20 seconds, but unusually, this year, the start pens were 100m long to enable social distancing, which resulted in runners taking eight minutes to cross the line, with two going off at three-second intervals.

Both also achieved PBs. Charlie Metcalfe (Ryde Harriers) won the women\xe2\x80\x99s race in 2.56.38 and, in doing so, set a new course record \xe2\x80\x94 beating the record of Sarah Hill (Farnham Runners), who came second in 3.10.26.
