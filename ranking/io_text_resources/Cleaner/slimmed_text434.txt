Malcolm Burr, chief executive of Western Isles Council, left, Scottish Government minister Paul Wheelhouse and Frank Mitchell, chief executive of Skills Development Scotland.\xe2\x80\x9cBut also, of course, it has changed, and there will be elements that have changed for the better, but it has disrupted the programme of service redesign and transformation, on which we embarked and which have brought a great deal of savings, but inevitably it slows that, it halts that.\xe2\x80\x9dMr Burr added: \xe2\x80\x9cSo that combination of prudent savings, use of balances, combined with service redesign and transformation, is under threat at a time when we are all hit with massively lost income.\xe2\x80\x9dJonathan Belford, chief finance officer at Aberdeen City Council, told the committee that Sport Aberdeen and Aberdeen Performing Arts were among the hardest hit.I think, in terms of scale, it would be helpful maybe to say, from an Aberdeen perspective, that amounts to about \xc2\xa320m of external customer income that was immediately switched off.\xe2\x80\x9dJonathan Belford, chief finance officer at Aberdeen City Council\xe2\x80\x9cThere was a clear and immediate impact on our arm\xe2\x80\x99s-length external organisations, culture and sport, where incomes externally generated by customers were immediately effected,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\xe2\x80\x9cI think, in terms of scale, it would be helpful maybe to say, from an Aberdeen perspective, that amounts to about \xc2\xa320m of external customer income that was immediately switched off.\xe2\x80\x9cSo they went into a particularly challenging position.\xe2\x80\x9d Jonathan Belford, chief finance officer at Aberdeen City Council.Mr Belford added: \xe2\x80\x9cI think the challenge definitely has extended to all parts of the council, whether that has been staff who have continued working through the pandemic, working from home, for example, dealing with the sustained period working away from the office, and dealing with staff and the mental health issues that arise out of that.\xe2\x80\x9dAdditional costs in educationMr Burr also suggested that costs were now rising in almost every service area.He said: \xe2\x80\x9cIn terms of finance, certainly social care and care for people have seen the most significant additional costs.\xe2\x80\x9cThere have been additional costs in the education side as well, as we move to blended learning, although my council sees itself as a leader, and I think rightly, in that field, anyway.\xe2\x80\x9cBut also the hidden costs of, particularly, capital works. We all know how small the capital programme pro rata other years was for this term of local government.\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the delays to critical investment programmes, and the additional cost to contractors, most of which are inevitably borne by those commissioning the projects, I would say have been the area of biggest cost.\xe2\x80\x9cBut now we are seeing, I think, costs in every service area increasing, other than, I think, the obvious minor savings in travel and subsistence, and minor budget adjustments like that.\xe2\x80\x9dBlended working survey resultsMr Burr signalled that buildings could be sold, as he said staff surveys at Western Isles Council had found 90% favoured a move to a \xe2\x80\x9cblended working model\xe2\x80\x9d.\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that of course builds on our other strategies of reducing the number of buildings we occupy, of sharing needs with other public sector bodies,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Blended working could be introduced in the future.And the chief executive indicated that library services may never return to their previous way of operating, following changes made during the pandemic.\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose the biggest change has been in our library service, which was not back on until, really, last month,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\xe2\x80\x9cAt the moment, we are really operating that partly online, partly by presence, in that you choose your books online and collect and return them in the library.\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, I have to say, I thought that would be criticised by the public but it seems to have been readily accepted, and I have to wonder if that is maybe a model for the future.\xe2\x80\x9cWe have to make sure, of course, that those who are digitally excluded would be able to partake in that, perhaps through the continued use of the mobile libraries.\xe2\x80\x9cBut that is one example where we will certainly be looking to change things.\xe2\x80\x9dHelp support quality local journalism \xe2\x80\xa6 become a digital subscriber to the Evening ExpressFor as little as \xc2\xa35.99 a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe {background-color: #444444;}.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title {color: #ffffff;}.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content p {color: #ffffff;}.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn {background-color: ##e21533;color: #ffffff;}.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn:hover,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn:focus,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn:active {background-color: #ffffff;color: ##e21533;}Tagschief executive of Comhairle nan Eilean Siarchief finance officer at Aberdeen City Councilcoronaviruscouncil financeCovid-19Jonathan BelfordLocal Government CommitteeMalcolm BurrmpPandemicPoliticsMore from the Evening Express Specials teamSpecialsBrexit fisheries talks: All you need to know as negotiations enter extra time15/10/2020SpecialsNew face mask rules: Sturgeon says \xe2\x80\x98You may kiss the bride\xe2\x80\x9915/10/2020SpecialsCeltic v Rangers: First Minister makes her pitch to Sky Sports15/10/2020More from the Evening ExpressBrexit fisheries talks: All you need to know as negotiations enter extra timeBrexit end game sees negotiators clash on fishing proposalsNew face mask rules: Sturgeon says \xe2\x80\x98You may kiss the bride\xe2\x80\x99Celtic v Rangers: First Minister makes her pitch to Sky SportsTwo drivers taken to hospital following crash on major north-east roadBest 2020 Christmas presents for kids, according to Hamleys expertsScottish council chiefs warn of spiralling costs and budgets being \xe2\x80\x98blown away\xe2\x80\x99Next PostFollow Evening ExpressMore infoWebsite Terms and Conditions of UseCookie PolicyCookie PreferencesPrivacy PolicyContact usDigital EditionReader PanelShopDatingJobsNewsletterGoogle Consumer Surveys \xe2\x80\x93 all you need to knowReader TravelBook an AdvertBuy PhotosFamily AnnouncementsMedia PackDC Thomson MediaThe Press and JournalThe CourierEvening ExpressEvening TelegraphThe Sunday PostEnergy VoiceSociety#wpc-dct-media-logo .prim { fill: #fff; }#wpc-dct-media-logo .seco { fill: #fff; }DCT Media Logo\xc2\xa9 Aberdeen Journals Ltd 2020.
