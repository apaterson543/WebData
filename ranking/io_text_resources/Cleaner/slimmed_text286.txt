By: Carol Patton | September 28, 2020 \xe2\x80\xa2 2 min read Topics: Company culture | Coronavirus | Employment Law | Engagement | HR analytics | HR Leadership | Issues | Issues | Retention | Talent Acquisition | Talent Management | Top Stories | Top Stories (Photo by Asanka Ratnayake/Getty Images) Many HR professionals are involved in a process they never imagined: contact tracing.And the novelty of the situation is prompting questions to pop up in every workplace, industry and state: How far back should you trace? What role do state and local health departments play? If an employee tests positive, how deep of a dive is needed?Related: What other legal questions face HR in the age of COVID?In the process of informing employees about COVID-19 exposure, HR may unintentionally expose its employer to legal trouble, mainly for violating confidentiality rules.Advertisement\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s quite clear that you can\xe2\x80\x99t disclose the identity of the [employee] who tested positive,\xe2\x80\x9d says Susan Kline, partner at Faegre Drinker law firm. \xe2\x80\x9cProbably 90% of the time employees figure it out on their own but the answer needs to be, \xe2\x80\x98Cheryl is on approved leave, and we expect her back after a couple of weeks.\xe2\x80\x99 Repeat it as often as needed.\xe2\x80\x9dRelated: Sources and strategies to ease the return-to-workplaceSome HR professionals have been pressured to release the names of employees who test positive; however, Kline says information obtained through contact tracing must be treated like a confidential medical record and kept separate from personnel files.Susan KlineMeanwhile, HR should not underestimate the importance of choosing the right person to perform this type of detective work. Successful tracers not only guard employee privacy but also demonstrate a good bedside manner\xe2\x80\x94consider selecting someone with a medical background for the job\xe2\x80\x94and can solicit sensitive health information from workers without making them afraid that they or their co-workers will be fired or disciplined.Likewise, focus inquiries on contacts that occurred during the workday, not when employees are off work or at lunch unless it\xe2\x80\x99s on the premises. Otherwise, HR risks being branded as \xe2\x80\x9cBig Brother,\xe2\x80\x9d which can stir up legal issues surrounding privacy.See also: Why HR needs to watch out for \xe2\x80\x98immunity discrimination\xe2\x80\x99By now, an organization\xe2\x80\x99s contact-tracing plan or policy should be developed, well-documented and in place. Being unprepared may lead to panic, anxiety and costly legal mistakes, Kline says. Just as important, clearly communicate to employees what contact tracing is, why it\xe2\x80\x99s needed and what to expect to avoid surprises.Also, HR can legally tell employees who test positive to self-quarantine offsite for 14 days. If they\xe2\x80\x99re not symptomatic, Kline says, they can also be asked to work remotely.Advertisement\xe2\x80\x9cIf the person refuses, which is like any refusal to work, it can be grounds for dismissal,\xe2\x80\x9d Kline says. But give them the benefit of the doubt. Ask why since there can be many legitimate reasons behind their decision.Typically, employee dishonesty during contact tracing may also be grounds for termination.\xe2\x80\x9cThey have to be honest and cooperative,\xe2\x80\x9d says Kline. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not asking for medical information, you\xe2\x80\x99re only asking about close contacts while at work. That\xe2\x80\x99s fair game.\xe2\x80\x9d Carol Patton is a contributing editor for HRE who also writes HR articles and columns for business and education magazines.
