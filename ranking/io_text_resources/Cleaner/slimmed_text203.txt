b' Joe Biden tested negative for coronavirus but he\'s not totally in the - Fact News | Dailymv Home Watch Now Joe Biden tested negative for coronavirus but he\'s not totally in the Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden said he and his wife Jill tested negative for coronavirus on Friday, but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean they are both totally in the clear.\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m happy to report that Jill and I have tested negative,\xe2\x80\x9d Biden said on Twitter. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you to everyone for your messages of concern. I hope this serves as a reminder: wear a mask, keep social distance, and wash your hands.\xe2\x80\x9dBiden and President Trump, who tested positive for the virus, shared the stage for the first presidential debate on Tuesday. Vice President Mike Pence, as well as Biden\xe2\x80\x99s running mate Kamala Harris, also tested negative. A negative test does not necessarily mean a person does not have the coronavirus. It typically takes five to seven days after exposure to have enough virus in the body to generate a positive test result. If someone takes the test before that window and tests negative, it could just mean they do not yet have enough virus in their body to be detected by the test, and could test positive a few days later. Most people begin having symptoms around five days after exposure, though for some it can take up to 14 days. For that reason, Biden and others Trump came into contact with around the time he was infected should be monitored or retested for the next 14 days to make sure they truly are negative, infectious disease experts said.\xe2\x80\x9cThese are high-level administration officials who were exposed and we need to ensure all of these people are tested. And you can\xe2\x80\x99t just test them now. They need to be watched for 14 days,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, a Stanford infectious disease expert. \xe2\x80\x9cVice President Biden tested negative but we don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he won\xe2\x80\x99t turn positive in another day. He was pretty close, without a mask, and there were a lot of droplets from the raised voices.\xe2\x80\x9dIt is unclear when exactly Trump began experiencing symptoms. Some news reports say he appeared lethargic during a fundraiser on Thursday. People with the coronavirus are infectious three to four days before they start showing symptoms, and become more infectious once symptoms begin. That means Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s debate could be within Trump\xe2\x80\x99s window of infectiousness. The debate setting checks some of the boxes for the type of higher-risk environment people are advised to avoid during the pandemic: indoors, where there was prolonged talking without masks. However, because Trump and Biden were more than six feet apart, Biden does not meet the definition of a close contact who should self-quarantine, which is defined as more than 15 minutes and within six feet, said UCSF\xe2\x80\x99s Dr. George Rutherford. Because Trump was not yet symptomatic at that time, it is less likely he infected Biden because people are less infectious when they don\xe2\x80\x99t yet have symptoms, said Dr. Lee Riley, a professor of infectious diseases at UC Berkeley School of Public Health.\xe2\x80\x9cI highly doubt (Biden) got infected from that episode, even though the president was shouting loudly and spitting out a lot of spit,\xe2\x80\x9d Riley said.All data is taken from the source: http://sfchronicle.comArticle Link: https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/Joe-Biden-tests-negative-for-coronavirus-15616211.php#Biden #newsbbc #newsworldbbc #newstodayfox #newsworldabc #newstoday # #Joe Biden #biden #tested #negative #coronavirus #totally By: Fact News | 1 week ago #biden Joe Biden tested negative for coronavirus but he\'s not totally in the #democratic Democratic nominee Joe Biden campaigns in Michigan after testing negative #biden Joe Biden vs. Barack Obama - Politics Is Theater - 2008 Flashback [RUSSIANVIDS/RV TRUTH] #biden Joe Biden 80\'s Flashback - Politics Is Just A Bad Movie [RUSSIANVIDS/RV TRUTH] #biden Joe Biden AMEA\xc3\x87A: o BRASIL SOFRER\xc3\x81 consequ\xc3\xaancias GRAVES (Felipe Dideus) #biden JOE BIDEN gana protagonismo a un mes de las ELECCIONES | RTVE #biden Joe Biden Jill Biden Test Negative For Coronavirus After President Trump Melania Trump Test Positive #donald Donald Trump is Insulting PM Modi and India During Debate with Joe Biden #donald Donald Trump ve Joe Biden\'\xc4\xb1n "hakaret" d\xc3\xbcellosu | HT 360 - 30 Eyl\xc3\xbcl 2020 #donald Donald Trump Brings Proud Boys And Oakland Back Into Focus During Presidential Debate With Joe Biden #biden Joe BIDEN GAN\xc3\x93 el PRIMER DEBATE seg\xc3\xban Gustavo Palomares, decano de la UNED | RTVE #president President Donald Trump, Former VP Joe Biden face off in presidential debate Tuesday night #verify VERIFY: Will Judge Amy Coney Barrett have to step down if Joe Biden is elected president? #biden Joe Biden Wins First Debate 2020 vs Trump With \xe2\x80\x9cWill You Shut Up, Man!
