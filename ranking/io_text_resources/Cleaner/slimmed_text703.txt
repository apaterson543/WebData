The 50 Most Dangerous Jobs for Contracting COVID-19 By Gabrielle Olya of GOBankingRates | &lt; PREVIOUS SLIDE SLIDE 1 of 51 NEXT SLIDE &gt; The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended avoiding close contact with others as the most effective way to protect yourself from getting the coronavirus, but for some workers, this is impossible. Certain jobs require person-to-person contact, which puts those workers at risk for exposure. In general, healthcare workers are at the greatest risk \xe2\x80\x94 they have person-to-person contact every workday, often exposing themselves to people who have the coronavirus \xe2\x80\x94 but it\xe2\x80\x99s not just those who work in the healthcare field who are at high risk. To determine the 50 jobs that are the most dangerous in terms of contracting the coronavirus, GOBankingRates sourced data from Visual Capitalist. The site used information from\xc2\xa0the Occupational Information Network to calculate a \xe2\x80\x9cCOVID-19 risk score\xe2\x80\x9d based on three factors: (1) how much the job requires contact with others; (2) how much the job requires tasks to be performed in close proximity to others; and (3) how often the job requires exposure to hazardous conditions. Scores ranged from zero to 100, with 100 being the highest risk. Data on each occupation\xe2\x80\x99s average annual income and number of employees was sourced from the Bureau of Labor Statistics data gathered by Visual Capitalist. Information on whether the dangerous job is considered to be essential or nonessential is based on the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\xe2\x80\x99s guidelines on essential workers, plus reporting on which businesses and services closed during initial shutdowns because they were deemed nonessential.
