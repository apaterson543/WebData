The cases in the county Tuesday included 908 confirmed cases, up three from Monday, and 40 probable cases, no change from Monday.According to the United States Centers for Disease Control, the PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests that determine confirmed cases are more sensitive than the antigen tests that determine probable cases.No new local deaths attributable to the virus were reported Tuesday. Forty-seven Union County residents have died as a result of the virus. In the Southwest Public Health Region of Arkansas, where Union County is located, 96 people were hospitalized due to the virus Tuesday, including 40 in intensive care units and 18 on ventilator support.Five new recoveries were reported in Union County on Tuesday, bringing the total number of local residents considered recovered to 865. There were 36 active cases in the county Tuesday, down two from Monday and representing 3.8% of the cases identified locally. The active cases in the county Tuesday included 30 confirmed cases and six probable cases.An ADH report dated Oct. 5 on COVID cases in nursing homes in the state showed that 14 residents of Hudson Memorial Nursing Home had died as a result of COVID-19.The nursing home report also showed five active COVID cases, three in residents and two in workers, along with four recovered workers, at Advanced Health and Rehab of Union County; 57 active cases, 39 in residents and 18 in workers, along with 13 recovered workers, at Hudson; and one active worker case at Oak Ridge Health and Rehab.The ADH reported 28 new negative test results returned from Union County Tuesday, indicating a one-day local positivity rate of 9.7% based on the number of new cases and results reported. In all, 10,540 COVID-19 test results have returned from Union County, including 9,592 negatives, indicating an overall local positivity rate of 9%.In Arkansas, the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases grew by 641 to reach 88,071 Tuesday.

The active cases in Arkansas on Tuesday included 5,970 confirmed cases and 738 probable cases.Governor Asa Hutchinson delivered his weekly COVID-19 update Tuesday, first paying tribute to Pine Bluff Police Officer Kevin Collins, who was killed in the line of duty Monday afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9cWe express sorrow on that, and also tribute, and today I\xe2\x80\x99ve directed the United States and state flag fly at half-mast in honor of Officer Kevin Collins,\xe2\x80\x9d Hutchinson said.Hutchinson also announced a new directive regarding nursing home visitation Tuesday after sharing a letter he received from a nursing home resident who said they missed their family. The new directive will allow visitation at nursing homes after they have gone 14 days without any positive cases, as well as individual visitation for residents whose health has been impacted by the inability to see their loved ones.\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a very, very important step that is necessary and is the right thing to do,\xe2\x80\x9d Hutchinson said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are very concerned about continued good health in our long-term care facilities, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to continue to emphasize quality care \xe2\x80\xa6 quality screening and the protections to reduce the cases in the nursing homes; but we have to have some of that visitation under medically necessary circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.Hutchinson said medical concerns such as depression and disordered eating in nursing home residents contributed to his decision to update the directive on visitation to such facilities.The governor also shared a letter from Parkway Elementary School student Amanda Elizabeth Carter, the subject of which was Halloween.\xe2\x80\x9cIf we can go to school, then I think we should certainly be able to trick-or-treat,\xe2\x80\x9d Carter wrote.Hutchinson agreed, he said, and went on to provide guidance determined by the ADH for ways to celebrate Halloween safely, including: wearing a cloth face mask instead of or in addition to a costume mask; limiting the number of homes children visit while trick-or-treating; accepting and eating only factory wrapped candy; and participating in low-risk activities like carving pumpkins, decorating one\xe2\x80\x99s home or hosting a virtual costume contest.\xe2\x80\x9cAmanda, we want Halloween to happen here \xe2\x80\xa6 with appropriate health care guidance and doing the right thing, as you suggested,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.Hutchinson also acknowledged President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump\xe2\x80\x99s COVID-19 diagnoses.\xe2\x80\x9cWith the President and First Lady of the United States testing positive and the President being hospitalized, what I see across Arkansas is a new level of seriousness and carefulness about COVID. There is more consistent masking, there is more consistent following of guidelines,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.He urged Arkansans to get a flu vaccination so the state can avoid a \xe2\x80\x9ctwindemic\xe2\x80\x9d of widespread cases of both COVID-19 and the seasonal flu this winter.\xe2\x80\x9cWe should all be reminded of the seriousness of COVID and, as we enter flu season, we have to remember that there is potential of flu and there is the potential for COVID,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have viruses running around in the nation; and because of flu season, because of the risk of COVID, we don\xe2\x80\x99t want double trouble this winter, so we encourage everyone to get the flu shot and to continue to be careful of COVID.\xe2\x80\x9dADH Secretary Dr. Jose Romero said an updated report from the White House Coronavirus Task Force showed \xe2\x80\x9cimpressive\xe2\x80\x9d declines in cases in key areas of the state.\xe2\x80\x9cWhich shows that we are making progress; but those advances are tenuous and can be fragile, so we need to keep in mind that the mask mandate, social distancing and washing our hands is extremely important,\xe2\x80\x9d Romero said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe know that this is a highly contagious virus and we have very good ways of preventing transmission and that is with the use of a cloth mask and, again, physical distancing.\xe2\x80\x9dDr. Ivy Pfeffer, a deputy commissioner for the Arkansas Department of Education, also announced Tuesday that the state would implement a new program to help school districts identify and engage with virtual students who are struggling in that environment.The deaths of 22 Arkansans that resulted from COVID-19 were reported Tuesday, bringing the state\xe2\x80\x99s death toll to 1,469, indicating a state COVID mortality rate of 1.7%. There were 523 Arkansans hospitalized due to the virus Tuesday, including 237 in ICUs and 99 on ventilator support.\xe2\x80\x9cWe do have adequate hospital space, there is sufficient room for the cases. We\xe2\x80\x99re not in a most difficult circumstance, but we want to see those numbers go down over time,\xe2\x80\x9d Hutchinson said.Hutchinson said 7,216 COVID-19 test results returned to the ADH Tuesday, including 6,157 PCR test results and 1,059 antigen test results, indicating a one-day positivity rate for the state of 8.9% based on the number of new cases and results reported.
