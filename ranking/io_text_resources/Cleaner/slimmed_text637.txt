Exciting opportunities in the world of chicken de-beaking await. I\xe2\x80\x99m Rishi Sunak, and these are the benefits of your new minimum wage career:\xc2\xa0For office workersNo more of that sedentary life cooped up inside under fluorescent lighting for you. See the world and get ripped by becoming a delivery driver. Those heavy Amazon boxes will do wonders for your biceps, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll get a cardio workout running back and forth to your van.For writersIt\xe2\x80\x99s notoriously hard to earn a living from writing. This is not the case with gutting fish or grinding up turkey carcasses. A job in the processed food industry will give you a rare taste of financial security and authentic life experience to turn into a play you\xe2\x80\x99ll be too exhausted to ever write.For university lecturersAs Tories only really need Oxbridge, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if all the other universities shut down. There are plenty of other opportunities for academics \xe2\x80\x93 if you\xe2\x80\x99re a historian, why not wear 19th-century costume and give tours about ghosts or Jack the Ripper?For skilled manual workersThere\xe2\x80\x99s really little difference between assembling complex microcircuitry and making a double quarter pounder with cheese as far as I can tell. They\xe2\x80\x99re both jobs you do with your hands, so much of a muchness. Accept your drop in pay with good grace.For musiciansIf you\xe2\x80\x99re not a rich rock star, what business do you have calling yourself a musician anyway? Don\xe2\x80\x99t blame us because you didn\xe2\x80\x99t break America. Classically-trained guitarists can easily pick up Wonderwall for well-renumerated busking, and nimble-fingered pianists will be great at picking Brussels sprouts.For artistsFrom Picasso to Tracey Emin, artists have made us ask \xe2\x80\x98What is art?\xe2\x80\x99 Who is to say woodstaining a fence or doing skirting boards duck-egg blue isn\xe2\x80\x99t just as valuable to society as whatever\xe2\x80\x99s on show at the Saatchi?\xc2\xa0 Once again the arts are safe in the hands of the Tories.Science is bullshit, says man whose life has just been saved by it6th October 2020 DONALD Trump has confirmed that science, medicine and doctors are a load of bullshit.The US president, whose life was just saved by cutting-edge Covid-19 treatments, held a post-hospital press conference where he advised everyone to burn their face masks and ignore doctors.He continued: \xe2\x80\x9cWhile I was in hospital getting pumped full of medicines to stop me dying, I had a lot of time to reflect on what a bunch of losers these doctors are.\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re telling us to be afraid, to wear face coverings like a bunch of Muslims and even to hide our faces when we\xe2\x80\x99re coughing like we\xe2\x80\x99re scared of a little cough.\xe2\x80\x9cThey don\xe2\x80\x99t even realise that even if you get the bug it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter because you\xe2\x80\x99ll get taken straight to your own private ward in a beautiful hospital with a unbelievable team of physicians whose sole job is to keep you alive.\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the drugs they give you are just phenomenal. The most incredible drugs. At one point I was so out of it that I thought my attractive daughter was actually my wife.\xe2\x80\x9dHe concluded: \xe2\x80\x9cSo don\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid and don\xe2\x80\x99t believe science. There is no coronavirus and I just beat it all on my own. Amazing.
