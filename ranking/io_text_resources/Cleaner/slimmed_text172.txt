I think the president has an opportunity that he is missing and I think he has an opportunity to do a public service and I think he\'s right now doing a public disservice to say to the people of this country. Uh look at me. don\'t worry about coveted look how well I\'m doing. First of all. this is a funny disease. We hope you\'re doing well, but the disease still hasn\'t run its course and uh it\'s a little premature to say I\'m doing great. Right uh you\'re not really doing great until you test negative. Then by the way there are people who test negative and have consequences uh that continue for weeks and months and months, this is a frightening virus, but the president is not analogous to the average person in this country. right uh the average person gets coveted they don\'t get. By helicopter to Walter Reed Hospital and have a team of twenty doctors. Millions of dollars of medical talent attend to their needs, receive experimental drugs that haven\'t been available to the public uh and are administered just to the president and the compassionate care right uh so there\'s no analogy there from a public service point of view 200. Thousand people died more people uh die in this country than uh countries around the world that were doing much uh worse than we were from public service point of view. Don\'t be afraid of covet. No be afraid of coveted it can kill you don\'t be cavalier. This is just more than. This is where it started and you know the president God bless him. He tells you where he\'s going. We know that when covet started, he knew how bad it was going to be and he just lied about it. We know that he had the White House memo done by Peter Navarro. That said, millions of people could get infected and he just lied about it. Woodward\'s book He actually has him on tape, saying I know how bad it\'s going to be, but I don\'t wanna tell the American people. Yeah. That cost this nation and that confusion cost this nation. uh many unnecessary lives and expense and pain and hardship. I was saying at that time, take it seriously. President was saying when it started, it\'s a hoax. it\'ll be gone by Easter. It\'s going to disappear like a miracle. Yeah. None of that was true. None it was true he knew it wasn\'t true and it\'s not true now to say, don\'t be afraid of covet denial doesn\'t work it never does in life. it never does. I don\'t have a drinking problem. I don\'t have a substance abuse problem. I don\'t have a gambling problem. Denial never works. Acknowledge the problem It\'s a frightening virus. Be smart, be careful. don\'t hide under your bed. We\'re reopening go about your business, but do it smartly and that\'s what the president should be saying.PagesMediaShowNowThis ElectionVideosGov. Cuomo Calls Out Pres.
