The only excuse you\xe2\x80\x99ll ever have for keeping a live starter is if you\xe2\x80\x99re baking for your neighbourhood.\xc2\xa0 Don\xe2\x80\x99t bother, otherwise.***** \xc2\xa0We did build an open fire pit in the garden so we\xe2\x80\x99ve reverted back to the African way of cooking over the open fire a bit.\xc2\xa0 That has been particularly enjoyable.\xc2\xa0 Possibly have gone feral making pallet furniture.\xc2\xa0 Yet to be completed.On the food note, I decided to sign up to a cooking newsletter on email.****** \xc2\xa0First edition just arrived.\xc2\xa0 Full of soup recipes.\xc2\xa0 Soup.\xc2\xa0 Even the word: soup.\xc2\xa0 Say it.\xc2\xa0 The mouthfeel of the word soup is not even satisfactory.\xc2\xa0 If soup is not accompanied by a nice big fat plate of toasted sandwich with everything in them (preferably snackwich style for dunking), it\xe2\x80\x99s not worth it.\xc2\xa0 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how I feel about drinking my food.\xc2\xa0 Never got into the juicing craze.\xc2\xa0 Smoothies need to be thick enough to eat with a spoon.*******I also have just realised thanks to the red underline that snackwich is probably not a well known term.\xc2\xa0 South Africans call toasted sandwiches with the sealed edges from the home toasting machine a snackwich does in fact have a good mouthfeel when you say it.\xc2\xa0 Far more satisfactory than soup.Cooking newsletter did not just seem to put soup on a pedestal.\xc2\xa0 It advocated biscuit making with lard.\xc2\xa0 Yeah yeah to the pros.\xc2\xa0 I get it.\xc2\xa0 Crispy biscuits.\xc2\xa0 Ireland has spoiled me for life.\xc2\xa0 Butter is queen.\xc2\xa0 Lard is not.\xc2\xa0 I love bacon, don\xe2\x80\x99t get me wrong.\xc2\xa0 But knowing the fat from the abdomen of a pig is inside my delicious crispy biscuit is just not a great feeling at all.\xc2\xa0 Similar to handling raw chicken.\xc2\xa0 It makes me want to scrub, violently, with soap and hot water.\xc2\xa0 At least I won\xe2\x80\x99t catch corona in my kitchen.\xe2\x80\x98Til next time.*Suffice to say, I cackle every time I see a man saying we\xe2\x80\x99re all inadequate if we haven\xe2\x80\x99t learned a new skill, blah blah.**Being A Responsible Human?***Didn\xe2\x80\x99t last a week.****Trying not to bare the evidence\xe2\x80\xa6definitely not a bikini ready summer, lads.*****You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome.******Feels like 1999 again.*******Smoothies count as food only when fruit to liquid (yoghurt) ratio is correct.By notesfromxanadu \xc2\x95 Posted in Covid 19, Farley\'s Philosophy, Food &amp; Drink \xc2\x95 Tagged 19, arts, asterisks, centre, column, coronavirus, Covid, farley, farley\'s, from, humour, notes, online, philipa, philosophy, xanadu0Post navigation\xe2\x86\x90 Hungry for Love, by Breda HylandOnly Real Necessity, by Autumn Black \xe2\x86\x92Leave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.Comment Name Email Website Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.
