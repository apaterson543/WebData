Previous Next U.S. Surgeon General cited for breaking Hawaiian coronavirus rules by snapping photos in a closed park The Washington Post 10/7/2020 Tim Elfrink \xc2\xa9 Michael Reynolds/Bloomberg Vice Admiral Jerome Adams, U.S. Surgeon General, speaks during a Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee hearing in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Wednesday, Sept. 9, 2020. The hearing is to examine vaccines, focusing on saving lives, ensuring confidence, and protecting public health. Photographer: Michael Reynolds/EPA/Bloomberg A police officer rolling by Kualoa Regional Park in late August noticed three men near the shore, snapping photos of the jagged jungle mountains and cerulean seas on Oahu\xe2\x80\x99s northeastern coast. The problem was that the park was closed under the island\xe2\x80\x99s pandemic restrictions. When the officer approached, one of the men explained that he had traveled to the island to work directly with Hawaii Gov. David Ige (D) on coronavirus prevention. The officer was unmoved, citing the men for breaking the emergency orders. It\xe2\x80\x99s unclear, based on documents reviewed by The Washington Post, whether the officer knew that one of the men cited that day is the \xe2\x80\x9cNation\xe2\x80\x99s Doctor.\xe2\x80\x9d U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams now faces a remote court date on Oct. 21 to answer charges that he violated the emergency orders by entering the park, a misdemeanor offense that could result in up to a $5,000 fine, up to a year in jail or both, the Associated Press reported. Adams\xe2\x80\x99s office didn\xe2\x80\x99t immediately return a message seeking comment; his spokeswoman declined to discuss the case with the AP. An attorney representing Adams said that the surgeon general didn\xe2\x80\x99t realize the park was closed. \xe2\x80\x9cDuring his visit to Oahu, the surgeon general was cited for accidentally violating the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s emergency order, due to his misunderstanding of the law,\xe2\x80\x9d Lex Smith, an attorney in Honolulu, said in a statement to the AP. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has not asked for, nor has he received, any special treatment in connection with this citation, and will respond to it appropriately.\xe2\x80\x9d The case comes to light as President Trump and his administration are assailed with charges that they haven\xe2\x80\x99t taken coronavirus restrictions seriously, a long-standing criticism given new currency by an outbreak that has now led to at least 18 coronavirus infections in the White House, including Trump and the first lady. But Adams may be among the least likely Trump administration officials to face a criminal case for violating pandemic restrictions. A self-described \xe2\x80\x9cnice person,\xe2\x80\x9d Adams is so rule-obsessed that he refused to cross the street on a mostly abandoned Mall until a red light changed when The Post\xe2\x80\x99s Manuel Roig-Franzia profiled him in July. Surgeon General Jerome Adams may be the nicest guy in the Trump administration. But is that what America needs right now? The 46-year-old anesthesiologist has faced strong criticism for his leadership since the beginning of the pandemic, especially for a poem he tweeted in February suggesting that the flu was a more pressing risk than the coronavirus, which has now killed more than 210,000 Americans. His national presence has mostly disappeared since an April appearance where he was accused of using racially insensitive language in urging minority groups to take the virus more seriously. But Adams has also become a strong voice in urging Americans to wear masks. He has recently traveled to coronavirus hotspots nationwide, urging the public to follow health and safety guidelines. That\xe2\x80\x99s why he was in Hawaii in August. The state, which has now recorded nearly 13,000 cases and 160 deaths as of early Wednesday, was seeing a surge in new cases at the time. To stem the tide, Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell (D) issued emergency orders that, among other measures, closed all public parks. Adams and his cohorts were violating that order, police said, when they were spotted in Kualoa on Aug. 23. The officer watched them strolling around the park and taking photos, and noted that Adams pulled a mask back on before returning to his vehicle. The surgeon general told the officer at the time that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know the parks were closed, according to his citation. An aide to Adams, Dennis Anderson-Villaluz, was also cited in the park, the AP reported. Three days after his citation, Adams stood next to the mayor whose emergency order he had allegedly violated to urge Hawaiians to follow the rules. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re seeing cases continue to go up, we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing positivity continue to go up,\xe2\x80\x9d Adams said at an Aug. 26 news conference, noting his support for the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s stay-at-home order at the time. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re calling on all of you to cooperate.\xe2\x80\x9d Go to MSN Home .bingNewsContainer h2::after, [data-aop="financeportfoliobingnewsmodule"] h3::after, .bingNewsContainer #pdp-module h3::after { content: "News from the Web";} AdChoices AdChoices More from The Washington Post Trump wants to be seen as a \xe2\x80\x98great environmentalist.\xe2\x80\x99 That could be a tough sell.
