worry, confusion, frustration, and fear for many. Unemployment is rising, and with it, the number of families who are now worrying about their living expenses. Unexpected medical bills can also add up and increase the financial burden. Due to this additional stress, options for mortgage relief and other resources have started popping up to help homeowners. A list of some of these resources has been compiled below.</p><h2>Resources from the Federal\nGovernment</h2><h3>CARES Act Mortgage Forbearance</h3><p>Forbearance allows you to temporarily stop or reduce your mortgage payments, which can be helpful if you are experiencing financial hardship. Through the <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/coronavirus/mortgage-and-housing-assistance/mortgage-relief/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="CARES Act (opens in a new tab)">CARES Act</a>, any Government-Sponsored-Enterprise (GSE) or federally backed mortgage (which includes mortgages from the FHA, VA, USDA, Fannie Mae, or Freddie Mac) can qualify for forbearance if the borrower is experiencing hardship due to the coronavirus pandemic. All you need to do is contact your mortgage lender or servicer, inform them of your financial hardship, and request a forbearance plan under the CARES Act. You can request forbearance for as long as 180 days, and at the end of that time, you can ask for an extension of another 180 days. Under the CARES Act, you won\xe2\x80\x99t have any extra fees, interest, or penalties due to having a forbearance plan.
