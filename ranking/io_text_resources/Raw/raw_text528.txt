Grady Memorial Hospital has a sterile room in its basement now devoted to manufacturing extra disinfecting wipes. A Stockbridge-based ambulance company has given an employee the full-time job of managing PPE. Nurses and doctors are still re-using masks that were designed to be used once and tossed away.

According to recent federal data, 34 Georgia nursing homes reported they lacked a one-week supply of N95 masks. Fourteen nursing homes reported they lacked a one-week supply of gowns and 13 reported they lacked a one-week supply of gloves.

They bought raincoats to use as makeshift hospital gowns. Paramedics snatched up painter masks at hardware stores. <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional/georgia-doctors-plan-for-wrenching-choices-amid-slim-ventilator-supply/wQsxpHBZ4NADgosPKG182N/" target="_blank">Hospitals drew up policies for who should get a ventilator</a> if two patients needed one and only one was left.</p><p class="story-text b-margin-bottom-d40-m20">That was spring and early summer. The U.S. solved the ventilator problem: President Trump in April invoked federal emergency law to help manufacturers get materials to ramp up production of the machines.

And there\xe2\x80\x99s no centralized U.S. buyer for small users like Maxey. She still competes not only with other Georgia health care businesses but with people across the globe.

That\xe2\x80\x99s partly because she is using so much more, masking up for every patient in case one might be infected.
