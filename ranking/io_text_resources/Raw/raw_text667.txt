But when the pandemic hit in March, Gallegos lost his job at an upscale restaurant in Georgetown. He couldn\\u2019t afford to pay his rent. Neither could his roommates. The landlord started turning up at the house, insisting they pay or move out.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cI told him I couldn\\u2019t go because we were in the middle of a pandemic,\\u201d Gallegos says.<\\/p>\\n<p>So the landlord called the authorities.<\\/p>\\n<p>A police report shows that the landlord, Abiyot Hirui, called to report a burglary at the townhouse on June 17. Police entered the home late and found Gallegos inside. He told them he was a tenant, not a burglar, and that Hirui had been harassing him and his housemates for weeks. The police informed Hirui that evictions were a civil matter and there was nothing they could do, and left.<\\/p>\\n<p>The following day, Gallegos says, he found the locks changed at the house. All of his belongings, including his HIV medication, were inside.<\\/p>\\n<p>Gallegos says he slept at Casa Ruby, a safe space for at-risk LGBTQ youth, that night. On June 19, he filed a complaint for wrongful eviction in D.C. Superior Court. The judge ordered Hirui to give Gallegos keys to the house that same day. But Gallegos didn\\u2019t want to stay there, he says, and he soon moved out. He\\u2019s now crashing at a friend\\u2019s home in Northwest D.C., occupying a small room off the back of the house, not sure where he\\u2019ll go next. And he\\u2019s still shaken from his experience.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt was a very ugly thing for me,\\u201d Gallegos tells WAMU\\/DCist through an interpreter. \\u201cI had nightmares. I couldn\\u2019t sleep. I couldn\\u2019t eat.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>Hirui did not respond to a request for comment, and his attorney referred WAMU\\/DCist to transcripts of his court hearings.<\\/p>\\n<div id=\\"attachment_6395704\\" class=\\"wp-caption alignnone\\" style=\\"width: 3010px;\\">\\n<p><a href=\\"https:\\/\\/wamu.org\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/10\\/072A9174.jpg\\"><img class=\\"size-full wp-image-6395704\\" src=\\"https:\\/\\/wamu.org\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/10\\/072A9174.jpg\\" sizes=\\"(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px\\" srcset=\\"https:\\/\\/wamu.org\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/10\\/072A9174-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\\/\\/wamu.org\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/10\\/072A9174-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\\/\\/wamu.org\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/10\\/072A9174-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https:\\/\\/wamu.org\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/10\\/072A9174-900x600.jpg 900w, https:\\/\\/wamu.org\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/10\\/072A9174-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\\/\\/wamu.org\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/10\\/072A9174-1600x1067.jpg 1600w\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"3000\\" height=\\"2000\\" \\/><\\/a><\\/p>\\n<p class=\\"wp-caption-text\\">Denis Gallegos, who was locked out of his home in June, now lives in the back of a friend\\u2019s house in Northwest D.C.<span class=\\"credits\\">Tyrone Turner \\/ WAMU<\\/span><\\/p>\\n<\\/div>\\n<p>Lawyers who represent low-income renters in the D.C. area say they\\u2019re encountering more stories like this as the pandemic lurches into its seventh month.<\\/p>\\n<p>The reason, they say, is the extreme economic uncertainty wrought by the crisis, combined with waning government assistance. The region\\u2019s jobless rate was close to 7% in August, unemployment benefits are running out, and as many as 715,000 renters in D.C., Maryland and Virginia are now\\u00a0at risk of eviction, <a href=\\"https:\\/\\/www.aspeninstitute.org\\/blog-posts\\/the-covid-19-eviction-crisis-an-estimated-30-40-million-people-in-america-are-at-risk\\/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">according to the Aspen Institute<\\/a>. Some landlords have become desperate to replace out-of-work residents with new ones who can pay the rent. Consequently, more are evicting tenants without court orders, which is illegal.<\\/p>\\n<p>There are restrictions on evictions during the pandemic. A sweeping national mandate from the Centers for Disease Control <a href=\\"https:\\/\\/dcist.com\\/story\\/20\\/09\\/02\\/cdc-federal-eviction-ban-dc-maryland-virginia\\/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">halts evictions for renters who earn less than $99,000 annually until the end of the year<\\/a>. In D.C., landlords are barred from evicting tenants for any reason while the city remains under a state of emergency. But these measures only prevent legal evictions. Landlords who choose to evict tenants illegally may not have gone through the courts anyway, advocates say.<\\/p>\\n<p>Tracking, and stopping, illegal evictions can be challenging. Eviction filings in Northern Virginia were down 85% earlier this year compared to 2018, <a href=\\"https:\\/\\/rampages.us\\/rvaevictionlab\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/33937\\/2020\\/09\\/Evictions-in-the-Commonwealth-during-the-COVID-19-Pandemic-1.pdf\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">according to the RVA Eviction Lab<\\/a>, likely because the state\\u2019s high court issued a series of temporary eviction bans <a href=\\"https:\\/\\/dcist.com\\/story\\/20\\/08\\/07\\/virginia-evictions-moratorium-ralph-northam-september\\/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">through September<\\/a>. But the data don\\u2019t capture evictions that take place outside the courts. A <a href=\\"https:\\/\\/www.nhlp.org\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/Evictions-Survey-Results-2020.pdf\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">recent national survey<\\/a> of legal aid and civil rights attorneys showed widespread reports of illegal lockouts. Some advocates call these \\u201cinvisible evictions\\u201d because they don\\u2019t leave a paper trail.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe\\u2019re hearing stuff like this pretty steadily now,\\u201d says Elaine Poon, managing attorney at Legal Aid in Charlottesville. She says her office received three calls about illegal evictions just last week. \\u201cIt\\u2019s kind of at an all-time high.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>In one case brought to Poon\\u2019s office, a renter reported that after their landlord lost his eviction case in court, he threatened to come to their house every day until they vacated the property. Poon suspects that many renters facing intimidation from their landlords simply move out to avoid a fight.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cWhat ends up happening is a lot of landlords get away with it,\\u201d she says.<\\/p>\\n<p>Invisible evictions, Poon says, often affect immigrant households.<\\/p>\\n<p class=\\"pullquote pull-right\\">Renters facing intimidation from their landlords will often move to avoid a fight. \\u201cA lot of landlords get away with it,\\u201d says attorney Elaine Poon.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey don\\u2019t always know what the law is here, and it might be that in [their] home country, there isn\\u2019t a lot of protection,\\u201d the attorney says. \\u201cThey just assume, \\u2018I\\u2019d better get out of here.\\u2019\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>Immigrants and other vulnerable renters are also affected by what\\u2019s known as self-eviction. That\\u2019s when a tenant moves out after receiving their first eviction notice, <a href=\\"https:\\/\\/dcist.com\\/story\\/20\\/06\\/15\\/eviction-notices-dc-md-va-covid19-pandemic-law\\/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">even though they\\u2019re not legally required to<\\/a>. Anecdotal evidence suggests self-eviction is on the rise during the pandemic, too. When Legal Aid staff recently visited the homes of Charlottesville residents slated for legal evictions, Poon says, they often found they had arrived too late.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cAlmost every single time, a huge percentage of the people had moved out already,\\u201d she says.<\\/p>\\n<p>The D.C. Council <a href=\\"https:\\/\\/dcist.com\\/story\\/20\\/09\\/22\\/dc-council-covid-eviction-ban-renter-protections\\/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">passed a temporary ban on issuing tenants eviction notices<\\/a> in September after hearing stories of self-eviction from advocates in the District. There\\u2019s no such ban in Virginia or Maryland. And <a href=\\"https:\\/\\/dcist.com\\/story\\/20\\/08\\/20\\/coronavirus-pandemic-eviction-dc-maryland-virginia\\/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">the protections that do exist<\\/a> in those states aren\\u2019t perfect, advocates say. In order to seek protection under the CDC mandate, renters must <a href=\\"https:\\/\\/www.cdc.gov\\/coronavirus\\/2019-ncov\\/downloads\\/declaration-form.pdf\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">sign a declaration affirming their lack of income and other details,<\\/a> and present it to their landlord. That requires a certain level of know-how, says Matt Hill, an attorney with the Public Justice Center in Baltimore.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cThe biggest problem [with the CDC order] is that folks really don\\u2019t know about it,\\u201d Hill says. \\u201cWe see a real lack of outreach and education.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>There\\u2019s also a significant loophole in landlord-tenant law that isn\\u2019t addressed by the mandate, Hill says. In Maryland and Virginia, landlords can simply terminate the leases of renters who fall behind on payments, then seek to evict them for overstaying their lease. (D.C.\\u2019s <a href=\\"https:\\/\\/www.localhousingsolutions.org\\/act\\/housing-policy-library\\/just-cause-eviction-policies-overview\\/just-cause-eviction-policies\\/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">\\u201cjust cause\\u201d eviction law<\\/a> bans this practice in the city.) Hill says these \\u201choldover\\u201d tenants aren\\u2019t necessarily covered under the federal eviction order.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cThere\\u2019s an open question, at least to some judges, about whether the CDC order applies in those cases,\\u201d Hill says. \\u201cThe order isn\\u2019t drafted as clearly as we would like.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>Regardless of how renters get evicted, they often wind up in one of three different situations: They move in with friends or family, often in crowded living conditions; bounce between temporary accommodations or shelters; or wind up on the streets. None of these outcomes are ideal under normal circumstances, let alone during a pandemic, Hill says.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cWe know that evictions lead to homelessness,\\u201d he says, \\u201cso we need to do everything we can to stop evictions.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p class=\\"pullquote pull-right\\">\\u201cLandlords don\\u2019t want to evict anyone, ever, let alone evict in the winter,\\u201d says Patrick Algyer with the Northern Virginia Apartment Association.<\\/p>\\n<p>Landlords and their surrogates don\\u2019t necessarily disagree, says Patrick Algyer, executive director of the Northern Virginia Apartment Association. He says most property owners view eviction as a last resort.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cLandlords don\\u2019t want to evict anyone, ever, let alone evict in the winter,\\u201d Algyer says. \\u201cThat\\u2019s just a horrible time.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>Still, Algyer says, landlords who have gone months without some or all of their rental revenue have to pay their mortgages, bills, maintenance expenses and taxes and without relief from local or national governments, they\\u2019re reliant on tenants, who are often struggling.\\u00a0Rent collection at professionally managed buildings across the country has fallen slightly during the health emergency, <a href=\\"https:\\/\\/www.nmhc.org\\/research-insight\\/nmhc-rent-payment-tracker\\/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">according to the National Multifamily Housing Council<\\/a>. Small, independent landlords have anecdotally reported losing rental income, too, though there\\u2019s no comprehensive data on rent collection at properties owned by \\u201cmom-and-pop\\u201d landlords.<\\/p>\\n<p>Without income, some landlords \\u2014 especially small ones \\u2014 risk defaulting on their mortgages. To avoid foreclosure, some may decide to sell their properties to condo developers, taking housing out of the already strained rental market.<\\/p>\\n<p>Like D.C. and Maryland, Virginia has committed millions of dollars to help struggling tenants pay their rent. But Algyer says Virginia\\u2019s $50 million rental assistance program \\u2014 paid for by the CARES Act \\u2014 hasn\\u2019t gone nearly far enough. At first, funds were only available to tenants, <a href=\\"https:\\/\\/dcist.com\\/story\\/20\\/09\\/25\\/virginia-landlords-covid-pandemic-rent-relief-help-tenants-ralph-northam\\/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">not landlords<\\/a>, so property owners had to wait for tenants to navigate the process of applying for, and receiving, payments. And because Virginians owed an estimated $169 million to $211 million in missed rent as of September, according to the RVA Eviction Lab, the assistance won\\u2019t reach everyone who needs it.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cAs this continues to snowball, we really have to start providing the landlords with more relief to help them get through this,\\u201d Algyer says. \\u201cAll we\\u2019re doing with this program is just kicking the can down the road.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>Landlords have lobbied Congress for economic relief, but they\\u2019ve hit a wall with Senate Republicans, many of whom oppose another coronavirus relief package. Real-estate interests have also mounted legal challenges to eviction bans on the state and federal level. <a href=\\"https:\\/\\/www.forbes.com\\/sites\\/brendarichardson\\/2020\\/09\\/18\\/national-apartment-association-joins-lawsuit-challenging-cdc-national-eviction-moratorium\\/#58420e2652d5\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">In one high-profile federal suit<\\/a>, landlords <a href=\\"https:\\/\\/nclalegal.org\\/rick-brown-v-secretary-alex-azar-et-al-ncla-challenges-unlawful-cdc-order-that-leaves-landlords-powerless-to-evict-delinquent-tenants\\/\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noopener\\">argue<\\/a> that federal agencies lack the authority to waive state laws, and that the CDC eviction ban encroaches on private property rights. Advocacy organizations including the National Housing Law Project and Legal Services of Northern Virginia have urged the court to deny the motion.<\\/p>\\n<p>But landlords and tenant advocates agree on at least one thing: the importance of large-scale rental assistance. Without it, they say, both landlords and renters will continue to struggle. Elaine Poon with Legal Aid in Charlottesville says renters temporarily saved by the CDC order could still become homeless once the mandate expires Dec. 31.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cThey will be evicted New Year\\u2019s Day in the dead of winter, and I doubt the pandemic will be gone by then,\\u201d she says.<\\/p>\\n<p>Denis Gallegos says his lockout experience was traumatic, but he thanks God that he had somewhere else to go.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt\\u2019s not comfortable,\\u201d he says. \\u201cBut I\\u2019m inside.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p><i>This article is part of our 2020 contribution to the DC Homeless Crisis Reporting Project, in collaboration with other local newsrooms.

There were fears about mass virus spread among an already-vulnerable population \\u2014 one that has little existing access to medical care and other kinds of support.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cJust living on the street, trying to survive day to day when you\\u2019re dealing with cold weather, hot weather, food insecurity, health issues, mental illness, addictions, there\\u2019s already a range of challenges,\\u201d Joe Mettimano, president and CEO of Central Union Mission, told <a href=\\"https:\\/\\/wamu.org\\/story\\/20\\/03\\/11\\/coronavirus-is-of-particular-concern-for-d-c-s-large-homeless-shelters\\/\\">WAMU\\/DCist<\\/a> at the time. \\u201cWhen you throw something else like coronavirus in the mix, it should make us all stop and pause and say, \\u2018OK. What are we doing as a society to really address homelessness in a meaningful way?\\u2019\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>By mid-May, Washingtonians experiencing homelessness\\u00a0<a href=\\"https:\\/\\/dcist.com\\/story\\/20\\/05\\/14\\/the-transition-to-quarantine-can-be-filled-with-anxiety-for-people-experiencing-homelessness\\/\\">faced disproportionate rates<\\/a> of infection \\u2014 269 individuals, nearly 6% of people in D.C. shelters, had tested positive for the novel coronavirus, compared to just 1% of the general population at the time. By October 8, that number had reached 349, and 21 people in the homeless service system had lost their lives due to COVID-19, according to the <a href=\\"https:\\/\\/coronavirus.dc.gov\\/page\\/human-services-agency-covid-19-case-data\\">Department of Human Services<\\/a>.<\\/p>\\n<p>The long months since the pandemic began have meant a slew of new dangers and difficult changes in the lives of unhoused people in the District, and Mettimano\\u2019s question from the spring has become more pertinent than ever. What about those who have no place to be safe from the spread of infection, no safety net when income is cut off?<\\/p>\\n<p>So, for a day, we walked from Northeast to downtown to speak to people experiencing homelessness. We asked them how the pandemic has altered their lives and what they want people to know ahead of the winter months. Here\\u2019s what they shared, in their own words. The interviews have been condensed and lightly edited for clarity:<\\/p>\\n<p><em><strong>Name:<\\/strong> \\u201cMomma J\\u201d (declined to give her full name)<br \\/>\\n<strong>Age:<\\/strong> Somewhere over 50 years old (Declined to give her exact age)<br \\/>\\n<strong>Hometown\\/Location: <\\/strong>Originally from Pennsylvania; Interviewed while sitting by the underpass between 1st and 2nd St NE on L Street in NoMa<\\/em><\\/p>\\n<p><strong>What has changed for you since the start of the coronavirus pandemic?<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<p>Well, what changed for me is contributions, because the people not comin\\u2019. That\\u2019s the main thing, the lack of people.<\\/p>\\n<p>Say like I went from, maybe $200 a week to maybe $150 a month.<\\/p>\\n<p>They used to come here to work all over here. I don\\u2019t panhandle because God said when you serve me, you ask me, and I\\u2019ll send you what you need. And the truth is, he do. Now, I mean, I got a big cutback, but I still eat, drink. I\\u2019ve never spent the night in a shelter and I have never been to one of them places to eat. People bring the food. But then, I\\u2019m prayerful, you know.<\\/p>\\n<p><strong>What role do you play in your surrounding community?<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<p>I\\u2019ve been out here since 2012, so I\\u2019ve been out here when it was no one. See, the tents ain\\u2019t start coming \\u2019til around [2016]. So for all them years, L street was mostly my street. And then people started coming, and then the construction.<\\/p>\\n<p>Everybody come to me for everything. Not just the people who live out here, but people going back and forth to work. And they call me Momma J because, you know, everybody come to me for everything and especially words of encouragement, spiritual words of encouragement.<\\/p>\\n<p><strong>On why the neighborhood dogs love her<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<p>One man used to buy me chicken on Fridays. A bucket of chicken, cause it\\u2019s $4.99. So that\\u2019s how I got to feeding the dogs. When the dogs walk past, they\\u2019d pull away from the owner and pull over there to me, smelling the chicken. And I\\u2019d say, \\u201cCan I give him a little piece?\\u201d So I started feeding the dogs. They want something every time they come, so I started buying dog treats.<\\/p>\\n<p>So for the last six, seven years, I\\u2019ve been feeding them. Sometimes, I say, \\u201cI don\\u2019t have nothing today,\\u201d because if I don\\u2019t have money, I can\\u2019t buy \\u2018em. But some of the owners will buy a couple bags or some of the owners will say, \\u201cWell, here\\u2019s $20, buy some more.\\u201d But you know, most of the people \\u2026 their dog come four times a day. You think they\\u2019d buy one. But I ain\\u2019t doing it for them to buy it. I was doing it cause I like doing it.<\\/p>\\n<p><strong>How are you feeling about the upcoming winter and planning for it?<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<p>I ain\\u2019t never wanted to go like I want to go now. I\\u2019m tired of being out here, because the winter\\u2019s getting colder instead of warmer, and I\\u2019m getting older instead of younger. And I don\\u2019t have peace no more. I\\u2019ve got other people\\u2019s filth, stealing, begging, all of that. I mean, I ain\\u2019t ready to throw in the towel. But I\\u2019m praying and hoping something to come besides for one of them government apartments that you worse off in.<\\/p>\\n<p><strong>Why do you avoid government assistance?<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<p>When I first came out here in 2012, my first day of homelessness, the spirit told me, do not get involved with them government agencies. It\\u2019s easy to get in, but it\\u2019s hard to get out. And nothing works out right. Like, a lot of people did get a place. They stayed in them maybe three months, [and then] they back out here.<\\/p>\\n<p>I don\\u2019t get checks. I don\\u2019t get food stamps because they government things \\u2026 The hardest part was not signing up for that stimulus. $1,200 at one time and you don\\u2019t have an income? But it\\u2019s government.<\\/p>\\n<p><strong>What else do you do to survive as it gets cold?<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<p>I\\u2019mma tell you what started saving me: them handwarmers. Put some in your shoes, put some in your coat pocket. And I sleep in this chair \\u2014 it\\u2019s a reclining chair. And put a couple under the bottom. And they\\u2019ve got the adhesive kind you can stick on. And they work. And then people bring you blankets.<\\/p>\\n<p>And different people that I met, they\\u2019ll come back and surprise me: \\u201cIt\\u2019s going to be so cold tonight. Me and my wife want to put you up.\\u201d When they first said that, I was scared to go. I don\\u2019t want to go to no hotel with no man, you know what I mean? But when he say the wife is going to come too \\u2026 I had like five or six of them. So when it\\u2019s cold, I was staying in a hotel 20 nights in a row. Because they come and say, \\u201cOh, it\\u2019s way too cold. You can\\u2019t stay out here tonight.\\u201d So God don\\u2019t put more on you than you can bear.<\\/p>\\n<div id=\\"attachment_4878185\\" class=\\"wp-caption alignnone\\" style=\\"width: 3010px;\\">\\n<p><img class=\\"size-full wp-image-4878185\\" src=\\"https:\\/\\/dcist.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/3\\/2020\\/10\\/072A9257.jpg\\" alt=\\"\\" width=\\"3000\\" height=\\"2000\\" \\/><\\/p>\\n<p class=\\"wp-caption-text\\">\\u201cWherever I go, I make beauty out of it,\\u201d says Zion Hazeur.<\\/p>\\n<\\/div>\\n<p><em><strong>Name:\\u00a0<\\/strong>Zion Hazeur<br \\/>\\n<strong>Age: <\\/strong>49<br \\/>\\n<\\/em><strong><em>Hometown\\/Location:<\\/em>: <\\/strong><em>Lived in New Orleans most of her life; Interviewed in NoMa at the corner of North Capitol St and L St<\\/em><\\/p>\\n<p><em><strong>Content Warning<\\/strong>: The following interview includes a story of sexual assault.<\\/em><\\/p>\\n<p><strong>How long have you been in D.C.?<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<p>I got here 7 months ago. When I first got to D.C., I got robbed. They took my I.D., my Social Security card, everything. That\\u2019s the first day I got here. I had like $520 because I had my stimulus check. And they took that. I had treated them to some drinks and cigarettes and when I was counting my money, they grabbed it out of my hands. So I was at square one the first day I hit D.C. Ever since I\\u2019ve been in D.C., youngsters poured water on my head because I was sleeping at the park. I got hit by a car. Two weeks ago, a lady hit me with a pipe. I got raped. Every day was some kind of horrible drama. But now I keep my head up. I stay positive. I know who I am. I know there\\u2019s a future for myself.<\\/p>\\n<p>If you\\u2019re homeless and you\\u2019re on the street, always know who you are. Don\\u2019t let no one take hope from you. You know you\\u2019ve got a future, you know what you\\u2019re living for, you keep going at it. So all they do is make me stronger and stronger and stronger.<\\/p>\\n<p><strong>How has it been different being homeless in a pandemic?<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<p>Oh, it\\u2019s most frustrating because I like to do things. I love to go to the library. I was in the pandemic in New Orleans, but I sensed trouble. I had to go, because it was full of [the coronavirus].<\\/p>\\n<p>It\\u2019s upsetting to me. I feel like you can not stop life. Open the libraries, open the churches, open the schools. You\\u2019re holding us back. It\\u2019s not natural.<\\/p>\\n<p><strong>Where do you sleep?<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<p>On the street. It\\u2019s so laid out that people take pictures of my place. Wherever I go, I make beauty out of it. But unfortunately, people get jealous so they tear my stuff apart and stuff like that, so I had to move on. I go to another location, I beautify everything, but if I leave and come back the next day, they steal all my stuff. So here I am now.

So right now, I\\u2019m just enjoying D.C., sightseeing. I do positive things, so there\\u2019s always a sunny side. I\\u2019m happy. I\\u2019m happy and content with myself.

I was incarcerated first, and I did reside here before I got incarcerated. Now I\\u2019m going through trying to find shelter again. It\\u2019s been a good experience and a bad experience.<\\/p>\\n<p><strong>Are there services that have been harder to get during the pandemic?<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<p>Those things that I need, as far as housing, income, and something to supplement my drug addiction \\u2014 suboxone, or other things that they give you to not use drugs or deter you from using \\u2026 It\\u2019s frustrating to wake up and not have those things in my life.<\\/p>\\n<p>I can\\u2019t just go to a psychiatry program and say, \\u201cI need this, I need that\\u201d and not have insurance.<\\/p>\\n<p><strong>Do you not have insurance right now because <\\/strong><a href=\\"https:\\/\\/dcist.com\\/story\\/20\\/07\\/30\\/d-c-is-making-changes-to-its-medicaid-program-critics-say-its-the-wrong-time\\/\\"><strong>D.C. is switching its Medicaid program<\\/strong><\\/a><strong>?<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<p>They\\u2019re saying they switched it to another HMO. OK. What happens to this until I get that?<\\/p>\\n<p>I went to the clinic, the gentleman said [I had insurance].\\u00a0I go to CVS to fill a prescription? Nothing.<\\/p>\\n<p><strong>What are some of the other things you need right now?<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<p>A dollar can be got. But I need that emotional support and that mental support. Someone to talk to. There\\u2019s things I need to talk about what\\u2019s going on in my life.<\\/p>\\n<p>And with my mental health, I don\\u2019t have my medications. I tell them I need my medicine. And I\\u2019ve been out there four, five months, and I haven\\u2019t gotten that. I take psychotic medication, sleep medication, HIV meds. I mean, I got the HIV [meds], but that was a struggle. I use illegal substances to medicate myself \\u2026 for depression. I deal with all that day by day.<\\/p>\\n<p><strong>What do you hope will change in the coming months?<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<p>I\\u2019m asking for help. I went into a detox seven days, but getting out, like I said, I don\\u2019t have insurance. So \\u2014 backslide. I\\u2019m right back where I was before I went into detox. I\\u2019m using again. What did I go to detox for? I went for help. Now coming out, I can\\u2019t get that help because of my medical insurance. So I\\u2019m stuck between a rock and a hard place.<\\/p>\\n<p>Every day I wake up and have a positive, praying mind, but soon, I get to moving and not having things that I need \\u2014 a day program or something that\\u2019ll for the hour, two hours, help my head \\u2026To be honest, y\\u2019all see what\\u2019s happening. Y\\u2019all are not dumb. The drug trade is happening as soon as I walk out the door. The devil says, \\u201cHere you go.\\u201d And I don\\u2019t want to do it, but it\\u2019s right there.<\\/p>\\n<p><strong>On fears of the coronavirus<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<p>This corona thing is what it is. They sugarcoat it to a degree, but it\\u2019s more subject to get right here because we don\\u2019t have the ventilation that we\\u2019re supposed to have. But it is what it is. I\\u2019d rather be in this building than out on this curb. I\\u2019m thankful to be able to have a bed, wash up, you know, every now and then get a hot meal.<\\/p>\\n<p>I have shelter. That\\u2019s the most important thing right now. And taking care of my health. But the shelter is there. You\\u2019ve gotta have patience. That\\u2019s part of it too.<\\/p>\\n<p>My situation is life-threatening to me. That\\u2019s why I\\u2019m standing here talking to you.

My husband died. I lost everything. So I\\u2019m just here. I sleep right down here on 9th and Massachusetts \\u2014 it\\u2019s a white church. I sleep there because there\\u2019s a canopy. But they\\u2019re getting ready to resume services. Everybody doesn\\u2019t clean up after themselves, so they no longer want us to sleep there.<\\/p>\\n<p><strong>What made you decide not to seek housing at a shelter?<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<p>It wasn\\u2019t a decision. They have very few shelters for women.<\\/p>\\n<p><strong>What have been some of the biggest obstacles you\\u2019ve faced during the pandemic?<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<p>I had a paper ID that expired back in May. You have to make appointments now. My appointment isn\\u2019t until February the 4th at the DMV to get an ID. You have to make an appointment for everything, because there\\u2019s only a certain amount of people that can go anywhere. We used to come in here, go sit down there. Now we can\\u2019t.<\\/p>\\n<p><strong>What\\u2019s your biggest concern?<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<p>I don\\u2019t wanna die out here on the street. It\\u2019s bad enough I\\u2019m homeless. I want my autobiography to have a different ending. I want to continue to grow old gracefully and be comfortable.<\\/p>\\n<p><strong>What gives you hope?<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<p>I\\u2019ve got a hobby \\u2014 self-taught knitting and crocheting. If you can describe it, I can draw it, I can measure it, I can make it. I could put any logo, any name or whatever on it. And I\\u2019m relaxed, I can hold a conversation, watch a movie, and never drop a stitch.<\\/p>\\n<p>But not out here. I have people that want me to make things for them, but I have to get stable housing. I already know where to get my yarn. I know what kind of yarn you can use for certain things. I would have to be stable, then I could start making things. Then perhaps, God-willing, I\\u2019d get a website: \\u201cPredetta\\u2019s Fine Knits.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p><strong>What resources have helped you during the pandemic?<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<p>This [Downtown Day Services Center] is the best resource center because they\\u2019ve got Pathways to Housing. They really work to help get you up off of the street, if that\\u2019s what you want. They help prepare you to do the transformation from homelessness to housing. I come everyday because I know I can get this meal. I need to eat something. [<em>Opens lunch box.<\\/em>] I\\u2019m tired of turkey everyday \\u2026 [<em>laughs<\\/em>] Sometimes it\\u2019s roast beef, but lately, it\\u2019s been turkey.<\\/p>\\n<p><strong>Are you worried about getting COVID-19?<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<p>Not really. If you don\\u2019t know that God is real, you need to know. If it\\u2019s for me, then I cannot escape it. So I have to go \\u2018head on \\u2026 We just have to learn how to live with the new world order, as it is. I don\\u2019t worry about that. God has the final say-so in all my matters. I cannot worry about a thing I cannot change.

You can\\u2019t sleep here, it\\u2019s private property.\\u2019 So there\\u2019s a real problem in D.C. Union Station, I can\\u2019t sleep there. I\\u2019m batting off rats. So, I make sure my dog is warm. She\\u2019s been doing fine, with coats and everything.<\\/p>\\n<p>It\\u2019s a problem. They need to open a new location [another women\\u2019s shelter] so we can pee and poop and eat and relax. And get through this. We have a right to hygiene. We have a right to everything. I mean, it\\u2019s just crazy. [<em>She points to a nearby portable toilet] <\\/em>This is filthy. They cleaned it out today, but I have pictures. It was overflowing.<\\/p>\\n<p><strong>Have you noticed a drop in foot traffic or the number of people who stop and offer help over the past few months?<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<p>No, there\\u2019s actually been quite a few really nice people who will come and give you things. But it\\u2019s like, we still need basics. Venues are not open for the homeless. You can\\u2019t even charge your phone. I have a laptop, but the library\\u2019s not available, you know?<\\/p>\\n<p><strong>Have you tried living at one of the shelters in D.C.?<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<p>They turned me away for the dog, at first. After that, the dog was cleared, but then my bag was too big. I had to leave it outside at night. I\\u2019m not leaving my bag outside, it would be gone. Who would do this? It\\u2019s ridiculous.<\\/p>\\n<p><strong>What have been your biggest concerns while out on the street?<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<p>I haven\\u2019t had a shower in quite a while, so this is a hygiene problem. We need soap and water. We want to smell good. Every day, we should be entitled to this. There\\u2019s no breakfast in the morning. People need that to look forward to \\u2026 a burrito, anything.<\\/p>\\n<p><strong>What do you want people to know about homelessness in D.C.?<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<p>People do not recognize the grief and the vulnerability of the homeless community. It\\u2019s not being addressed because they don\\u2019t talk about it. They don\\u2019t have a spouse that died. They don\\u2019t have a sister that died. Their grief is hidden, but they\\u2019ve had loss. They\\u2019re grieving. They\\u2019ve had a lot of loss and it sets them up in a very bad position to be taken advantage of.<\\/p>\\n<p><strong>Do you have a plan for when the weather gets colder?<\\/strong><\\/p>\\n<p>I\\u2019m feeling pressure that I might have to go to Florida or something. I don\\u2019t want to have to do that. I\\u2019m here to get Trump out of office, and I want to be here for the duration.

Area Residents Are Making The Most Of Bummer Birthdays","content":"<p>Around 2004, Vina Hutchinson\\u2019s friends gave her some advice as she reached the end of a difficult first marriage: \\u201cYou\\u2019ve got to take back your birthday,\\u201d and have a birthday month, instead.<\\/p>\\n<p>In particular, 2020 was supposed to be a special year. She planned to marry her fianc\\u00e9 of roughly a decade on Aug. 5, on her 54th birthday.<\\/p>\\n<p>Hutchinson had\\u00a0already put her wedding plans on hold a couple times; once when her soon-to-be father-in-law was diagnosed with Alzheimer\\u2019s, and again when Hutchinson learned she had breast cancer in 2018.<\\/p>\\n<p>When her fianc\\u00e9 asked what she wanted for her birthday this year, Hutchinson said: \\u201cI have everything I need. I just want you.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>Then, this spring, the pandemic hit. Her fianc\\u00e9 lives in the U.K. and couldn\\u2019t visit in August due to COVID-19 <a href=\\"https:\\/\\/www.wsj.com\\/articles\\/u-s-covid-testing-plan-aims-to-open-new-york-london-travel-by-holidays-11602337721\\">travel restrictions<\\/a>. And so Hutchinson\\u2019s birthday \\u2014 and her wedding \\u2014 were put on hold.<\\/p>\\n<p>Instead, the Suitland, Maryland, resident and her daughter went to Giant and bought a birthday cake that they ate at home.<\\/p>\\n<p>Hutchinson is among a number of Washingtonians whose birthdays were upended by the pandemic.\\u00a0Missing a birthday celebration may seem like a small inconvenience for some, but for others, birthdays offer an event to look forward to, and a sense of normalcy.<\\/p>\\n<p>Some Washingtonians had big plans to mark milestone years. Meredith Duffy, a senior at George Washington University, was studying abroad in Portugal before the pandemic. She planned to spend her 21st birthday in April traveling with a friend, but was sent home in March due to the health crisis.<\\/p>\\n<p>Duffy initially thought she might be able to go to a bar with friends to celebrate while at her parent\\u2019s house in Maine.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cOnce I got home, I realized the severity of the pandemic and that I was not going to be able to go to a bar anytime soon,\\u201d Duffy says.<\\/p>\\n<p>She ended up getting takeout pizza and playing \\u201cdrunk baseball\\u201d with five friends in the front yard, an activity her parents OK\\u2019d as long as they drove everyone home after. (Duffy\\u2019s friends who attended had already turned 21).<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cI still had a good day,\\u201d says Duffy. \\u201cIt was very different from what I planned, but we were able to make the most of it.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>Her day wasn\\u2019t without its 21st-birthday-style antics, either. At one point, Duffy says, the front yard games \\u201cgot out of hand\\u201d and a friend crashed into her dad\\u2019s folding table, which was holding the pizza and a pitcher of sangria.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cBut I guess that was the price to pay for my birthday being at my parents\\u2019 house,\\u201d she says.<\\/p>\\n<p>Other locals also got creative in the face of health and safety restrictions. Beth Gibson and her husband had originally planned to throw one, or even two, parties for his 30th birthday. But as the September date got closer, that looked less and less feasible for the Alexandria couple. Gibson decided to improvise.<\\/p>\\n<p>Her husband likes puzzles and escape rooms, so Gibson planned a scavenger hunt around their home and neighborhood. She planted clues, including a word search and a math problem that led her husband to a friend\\u2019s phone number. That friend gave him the next clue.<\\/p>\\n<p>He enjoyed doing the scavenger hunt so much that he told Gibson he was going to plan one for her, something they might never have done were it not for the pandemic. \\u201cWe probably would\\u2019ve done the party or parties that we had already been thinking about and I wouldn\\u2019t have brainstormed to try and come up with this.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>Danny DeLorenzo, an attorney who lives in Germantown, took his celebration outdoors. He began visiting a campground in Clarksburg fairly regularly during the pandemic as a way to get out of D.C., where he lived at the time.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cI was doing my work from there,\\u201d he says. \\u201cI had my hotspot hooked up. I was taking conference calls in the woods. It was great.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>He\\u2019d gone camping for his birthday before, and for his 41st in July, DeLorenzo decided to take a three-day trip. He went with a friend, though she got her own campsite as a safety precaution, and friends and family came to visit \\u201cin shifts.\\u201d There were never more than three people there at a time.<\\/p>\\n<p>DeLorenzo says the circumstances actually made it \\u201cmore memorable\\u201d than his 40th, which he marked with a big party. He says celebrating \\u201cduring this time was so much better than a normal day,\\u201d that it ended up being one of the highlights of his year.<\\/p>\\n<p>He added, \\u201cIt\\u2019s a pretty low bar for something being cool in 2020.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>Alicia H. Clark, a D.C.-based psychologist, says there are benefits to commemorating moments like birthdays, even if they aren\\u2019t particularly notable years.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cOn a small scale, we know that just acknowledging positives and celebrating them is something that\\u2019s both good for our mental health, it\\u2019s good for our relationships,\\u201d Clark says.<\\/p>\\n<p>And with \\u201cso many of our normal social anchors suspended in the pandemic,\\u201d celebrating a birthday with friends or loved ones, even online, can help \\u201cmake it real,\\u201d she says.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cIt makes it real to be with your best friend,\\u201d Clark says. \\u201cIt makes it real to be with another lifelong friend, and in making it real, it makes it more special, and you\\u2019re sharing. And that just amplifies all of the positives of the ritual.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>She advises adjusting expectations for the day and marking that ritual, \\u201cbecause it\\u2019s important for you \\u2026 and it\\u2019s important that it feel real and happy, especially now in the backdrop of so many disappointments and losses.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>Still, some have opted not to celebrate their birthdays at all. Jimmy Lee, who lives in Dupont Circle, typically would\\u2019ve gone to JR\\u2019s Bar and had drinks with friends. This year, though, he turned 53 alone in his apartment in July.<\\/p>\\n<p>Because of the coronavirus, Lee was only going inside at places like Safeway and CVS when he had to.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cNothing felt safe enough that risking doing something for that particular birthday would\\u2019ve been worth it,\\u201d he says.<\\/p>\\n<p>Lee lost his mother to the coronavirus in May, and his sister and brother-in-law both contracted COVID-19. He says the disease was \\u201cvery real\\u201d for him. As the public learned more about the virus, he tried to be as careful as possible.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cI figure it\\u2019s better to get to the next birthday than not,\\u201d he says. \\u201cSo, 54, I\\u2019d rather get there than try to do something for 53 that\\u2019s gonna make my life unsafe.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>Lee also says he decided not to celebrate because \\u201cone of my defense mechanisms [for the pandemic] is just to try and treat every day like any old regular day, so that you\\u2019re not feeling like you\\u2019re missing out on something.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n<p>For her part, Vina Hutchinson says that since having cancer, she sees every birthday now as \\u201cjust a victory.\\u201d She and her fianc\\u00e9 intend to get married eventually, though they don\\u2019t have firm plans yet. She says she\\u2019ll make up for lost time next year.<\\/p>\\n<p>\\u201cSo, this year\\u2019s birthday month wasn\\u2019t quite the big celebration it usually is, but next year, you know, double the celebration,\\u201d she says. \\u201cMight have to amp up to a birthday season.\\u201d<\\/p>\\n","paginatedContent":[],"excerpt":"<p>Missing a birthday celebration may seem like a small inconvenience
